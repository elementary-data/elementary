# Validating Unstructured Data with Elementary

## What is Unstructured Data Validation?

Elementary's `elementary.validate_unstructured_data` test allows you to validate unstructured data using AI and LLM language models. Instead of writing complex code, you can simply describe what you expect from your data in plain English, and Elementary will check if your data meets those expectations.

For example, you can verify that customer feedback comments are in English, product descriptions contain required information, or support tickets follow a specific format or a sentiment.

## How It Works

Elementary leverages the AI and LLM capabilities built directly into your data warehouse. When you run a validation test:

1. Your unstructured data stays within your data warehouse
2. The warehouse's built-in AI and LLM functions analyze the data
3. Elementary reports whether each text value meets your expectations

## Required Setup for Each Data Warehouse

Before you can use Elementary's unstructured data validations, you need to set up AI and LLM capabilities in your data warehouse:

### Snowflake
- **Prerequisite**: Enable Snowflake Cortex AI LLM functions
- **Recommended Model**: `claude-3-5-sonnet`
- [View Snowflake's Guide](/data-tests/unstructured-data-tests/snowflake)

### Databricks
- **Prerequisite**: Ensure Databricks AI Functions are available
- **Recommended Model**: `databricks-meta-llama-3-3-70b-instruct`
- [View Databrick's Setup Guide](/data-tests/unstructured-data-tests/databricks)

### BigQuery
- **Prerequisite**: Configure BigQuery to use Vertex AI models
- **Recommended Model**: `gemini-1.5-pro`
- [View BigQuery's Setup Guide](/data-tests/unstructured-data-tests/bigquery)

### Redshift
- Support coming soon

### Data Lakes
- Currently supported through Snowflake, Databricks, or BigQuery external object tables
- [View Data Lakes Information](/data-tests/unstructured-data-tests/data-lakes)


## Using the Validation Test

The test requires two main parameters:
- `expectation_prompt`: Describe what you expect from the text in plain English
- `llm_model_name`: Specify which AI model to use (see recommendations above for each warehouse)

<Info>
  This test works with any column containing unstructured text data such as descriptions, comments, or other free-form text fields. It can also be applied to structured columns that can be converted to strings, enabling natural language data validations.

```yml Models
version: 2

models:
  - name: < model name >
    columns:
      - name: < column name >
        tests:
          - elementary.validate_unstructured_data:
              expectation_prompt: "Description of what the text should contain or represent"
              llm_model_name: "model_name"
```

```yml Example
version: 2

models:
  - name: table_with_unstructured_data
    description: "A table containing unstructured text data."
    columns:
      - name: text_data
        description: "Unstructured text data stored as a string."
        tests:
          - elementary.validate_unstructured_data:
              expectation_prompt: "The text data should represent an example of unstructured data."
              llm_model_name: "test_model"
```

```yml Example - Validating Customer Feedback
version: 2

models:
  - name: customer_feedback
    description: "A table containing customer feedback comments."
    columns:
      - name: feedback_text
        description: "Customer feedback in free text format."
        tests:
          - elementary.validate_unstructured_data:
              expectation_prompt: "The text should be a customer feedback comment in English, it should describe only a bug or a feature request."
              llm_model_name: "claude-3-5-sonnet"
              config:
                severity: warn
```
