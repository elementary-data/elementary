`elementary.validate_unstructured_data`

Executes validation on unstructured data using LLM capabilities. This test allows you to validate unstructured data against specific expectations by leveraging language models to analyze the content.

The test requires:
- `expectation_prompt`: A prompt that describes your expectation on the unstructured data.
- `llm_model_name`: The name of the language model to use for validation. This parameter depends on your data warehouse type:
  - For Snowflake: Use the model name configured in your Snowflake account (see [Snowflake Setup](/data-tests/unstructured-data-tests/snowflake-setup.mdx))
  - For other warehouses: Refer to your specific warehouse's LLM integration documentation

<Info>
  This test is designed for columns containing unstructured text data such as descriptions, comments, or other free-form text fields. It can also be applied to any structured column that can be converted to a string. This enables writing data validations in native language.
