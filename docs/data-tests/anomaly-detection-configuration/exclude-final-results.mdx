`exclude_final_results: [SQL where expression on fields value / average]`

Failures in dimension anomaly tests consist of outliers in row count of each dimension.
Some dimensions may be considered insignificant compared to others, and you may prefer not to receive alerts for them.
With this parameter, you can exclude these dimensions from the results set and avoid such failures.

1. `value` - Max row count of a dimension during the detection period.
2. `average` - The average rows count of a dimension during the training period.

- _Supported values: valid SQL where expression on the columns value / average_
- _Relevant tests: Dimension anomalies_
