`where_expression: [sql expression]`

Filter the tested data using a valid sql expression.

- _Default: None_
- _Relevant tests: All anomaly detection tests_

The `where_expression` is used to filter out the data that you want to test. For example, to only test weekdays for anomalies, you can filter on the day of the week:
```yml
where_expression: EXTRACT(DOW FROM timestamp_column) BETWEEN 2 AND 6 
#Test Monday through Friday
```

<RequestExample>

```yml test
models:
  - name: this_is_a_model
    tests:
      - elementary.volume_anomalies:
          where_expression: "user_name != 'test'"
```

```yml model
models:
  - name: this_is_a_model
    config:
      elementary:
        where_expression: "loaded_at is not null"
```

```yml dbt_project.yml
vars:
  where_expression: "loaded_at > '2022-01-01'"
```
