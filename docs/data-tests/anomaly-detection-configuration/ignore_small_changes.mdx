ignore_small_changes:
  spike_failure_percent_threshold: [int]
  drop_failure_percent_threshold: [int]
```

If defined, an anomaly test will fail only if all the following conditions hold:

- The z-score of the metric within the detection period is anomoulous
- One of the following holds:
  - The metric within the detection period is higher than `spike_failure_percent_threshold` percentages of the mean value in the training period, if defined.
  - The metric within the detection period is lower than `drop_failure_percent_threshold` percentages of the mean value in the training period, if defined

Those settings can help to deal with situations where your metrics are stable and small changes causes to high z-scores, and therefore to anomaly.

If undefined, default is null for both spike and drop.

- _Default: none_
- _Relevant tests: All anomaly detection tests_
