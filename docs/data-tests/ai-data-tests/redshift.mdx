title: "Redshift"
---

Elementary's unstructured data validation tests do not currently support Redshift.

On Redshift setting up LLM functions is more complex and requires deploying a lambda function to call external LLM models. Documentation and support for this integration is coming soon. Please reach out if you'd like to discuss this use case and integration options.
