## Elementary CLI Setup

The CLI tool allows users to generate reports and visuallize results based on the tests we just configured. While we have already added the Elementary packages to our dbt project, the Elementary CLI requires a separate installation, as it is a Python tool.

<Warning>
  Important: Both dbt Cloud and dbt Core users will need to run the Elementary
  CLI locally. If you are a cloud user, you will need to ensure your
  configuration has met all the [prerequisites](/tutorial/setup).
</Warning>

  Run one of the following commands based on your platform:

## Running Elementary

Now that we have added Elementary tests to our schemas.yml file, it’s time to run our first tests. We begin by running on a subset of our data that is all valid:

```shell
dbt run --vars "{'anomalies': False}"
```

<Warning>
Note: Here we are setting the anomalies flag to False - only seeding valid data to our DWH.
</Warning>
<br/>
## Your First Test
Now that we have populated our data warehouse with valid data, we will run our tests and ensure that everything passes:
```shell
dbt test
```
All of our tests (except the dbt project's example tests) should pass. Now, let's visualize our results:
```shell
edr report
```

**You've just run your first Elementary report!**
<br/>
## Let's get real though...
Data is rarely perfect. Let’s get real and add some more data to our project:
```shell
dbt run --vars "{'anomalies': True}"
```
Now let's run our tests again:
```shell
dbt test
```
Now we should see our Elementary tests fail!
Now let's visualize this failure:
```shell
edr report
```
## Congratulations!
Congratulations, you successfully configured Elementary's tests and ran the report!
