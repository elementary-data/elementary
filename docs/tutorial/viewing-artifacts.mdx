## Elementary Artifacts
Now that we have downloaded the Elementary package, let’s understand its impact on our data. When we use dbt run, Elementary will generate a number of new artifacts in our database. These artifacts are used by Elementary for anomaly detection and testing.<br/>
To generate these artifacts use:
```shell
dbt run
```
To see these artifacts, we can navigate to our tutorial’s database; here, we will see a number of new Elementary artifacts have indeed been generated under `<schema_name>_ELEMENTARY`.<br/><br/>
These artifacts are used by Elementary tests and the Elementary CLI and will be updated when we run **dbt test**, **dbt run**, and **dbt build**.

**Next, let’s see how we add Elementary's tests and anomaly detection to our data.**
