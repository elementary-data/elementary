Elementary Slack integration includes sending [Slack alerts](../understand-elementary/elementary-alerts) on failures in dbt tests and models, and the option to distribute the [data observability report](../understand-elementary/elementary-report-ui) as a message attachment.

## Token vs Webhook

There are two integration options: Token or Webhook.
Both methods let you receive alerts from Elementary, but there are several features that are only supported in one of the two.
Below is features support comparison table, to help you select the integration method.

<TipInfo>
  If possible, Token is the preferred way. It allows more flexibility and
  supports more features than Webhook.

| Slack integration | Elementary alerts | Elementary tests report | Multiple channels | Slack workflows |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Token             | ✅                | ✅                      | ✅                | ❌              |
| Webhook           | ✅                | ❌                      | ❌                | ✅              |

## Slack Workflows

If you use [Slack Workflows](https://slack.com/features/workflow-automation), add the following configuration to your `config.yml` under the slack tag:

```yml config.yml
slack:
  notification_webhook: <your_slack_webhook_url>
  workflows: true
```

This flag `workflows: true` changes the format in which edr sends Slack alerts to the key-value pairs format supported by Slack Workflows.
The alert keys can be used to build a [Slack workflow](https://slack.com/help/articles/360053571454-Set-up-a-workflow-in-Slack).

The alert format is:

```json
{
  "alert_description": str,
  "table_name": str,
  "detected_at": str,
  "type": str,
  "description": str
}
```
