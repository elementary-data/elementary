## Data anomalies monitoring as dbt tests

Supports Bigquery since version 0.3.4

### BigQuery connection profile

After installing Elementary's dbt package upon running `dbt deps`,
you can generate Elementary's profile for usage with `edr` by running the following command within your project:

```shell
dbt run-operation elementary.generate_elementary_cli_profile
```

The command will print to the terminal a partially filled template of the profile that's needed for `edr` to work.
[Fill in the missing authentication fields](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-setups/bigquery-setup#authentication-methods)
in the output and copy it to `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`.

The `profiles.yml` file to connect to BigQuery should contain a profile in the following format:

```yml BigQuery
## BIGQUERY ##
## By default, edr expects the profile name 'elementary'.      ##
## Configure the database and schema of elementary models.     ##
## Check where 'elementary_test_results' is to find it.        ##

elementary:
  outputs:
    default:
      type: bigquery

      ## Service account auth, other options require other configs ##
      method: service-account
      keyfile: [full path to your keyfile]

      project: [project id]
      dataset: [dataset name] # elementary dataset, usually [dataset name]_elementary
      threads: 4
      location: [dataset location]
      priority: interactive
```

We support the same format and connection methods as dbt. Please refer to dbt's documentation
of [BigQuery](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-setups/bigquery-setup) for further details.

## Create BigQuery service account

For Elementary to be able to access the jobs by project in the information schema, there are two options:

1. Create service account with Project Owner or BigQuery Admin role. For this option, skip to create service account.
2. Recommended: Create service account with lower permissions by creating a custom role. For this option, you need to
   create the custom role first.

### Create custom role

1. In the Cloud Console, go to: IAM & Admin > [Roles](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/roles?pli=1)

2. Click on 'CREATE ROLE'

alt="Create role"
/>

3. Give the role a title, description, etc.

4. Click on '+ ADD PERMISSIONS'

5. Using the filter, find and add the permissions bigquery.jobs.listall and bigquery.jobs.create, then click 'ADD':

alt="Permissions"
/>

6. Click 'CREATE' and make sure the new role was created and is now in the roles list.

### Create service account:

1. In the Cloud Console, go to: IAM & Admin > Service Accounts

2. Click on 'CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT'

alt="Create service account"
/>

3. Fill in the service account name ('elementary') and account description ('Elementary Data') and click 'CREATE AND
   CONTINUE':

alt="Create and Continue"
/>

4. Now we need to configure the relevant permissions for this new service account. As described, at this point there are
   two options -
1. Option 1 - Choose BigQuery Admin or Owner.
1. Recommended: Option 2 - Choose the following 3 roles: BigQuery Data Editor + BigQuery User + custom role you created
   with these instructions:

src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mintlify/image/upload/v1659304878/elementary/roles_ug5z5a.png"
alt="Roles"
/>

5. The last step is optional so skip it if you don't need to manage this service account with another service account,
   and press done.

6. Press on the dots icon to the right of your screen for your new service account and select 'Manage keys':

src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mintlify/image/upload/v1659304878/elementary/dots-icon_aafqkv.png"
alt="Manage keys"
/>

7. Press on 'ADD KEY' and select 'Create new key':

<img

alt="Add Key"
/>

8. Use the 'JSON' option radio button and press 'CREATE':

<img
src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mintlify/image/upload/v1659304877/elementary/json_mybzda.png"
alt="JSON"
/>

9. This will automatically generate and download a JSON file with your private key information for this service account.
   This JSON file provides the credentials to programmatically connect and work with your BigQuery environment.

10. Add the full path of this JSON file to your connection profile under 'keyfile'.
