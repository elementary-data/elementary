## Partial Support

Currently, Elementary Databricks integration is partial, and supports:

1. Installing the dbt package to upload dbt artifacts, test results and run results.
2. Data observability report generation.
3. Slack alerts on failures in models and tests.

Elementary anomaly detection tests are **not supported yet**.

## Databricks connection profile

After installing Elementary's dbt package upon running `dbt deps`,
you can generate Elementary's profile for usage with `edr` by running the following command within your project:

```shell
dbt run-operation elementary.generate_elementary_cli_profile
```

The command will print to the terminal a partially filled template of the profile that's needed for `edr` to work.
[Fill in the missing authentication fields](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/databricks-profile#set-up-a-databricks-target)
in the output and copy it to `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`.

The `profiles.yml` file to connect to Databricks should contain a profile in the following format:

```yml Databricks
## DATABRICKS ##
## By default, edr expects the profile name 'elementary'.      ##

elementary:
  outputs:
    default:
      type: databricks
      host: [hostname, like <ID>.cloud.databricks.com]
      http_path: [like /sql/1.0/endpoints/<ID>]
      token : [token]
      threads: [number of threads like 8]
```
