Welcome to Elementary!

You’re moments away from source-to-BI observability that helps you spot issues early, trust your data, and enforce governance effortlessly.
AI agents will automate coverage, triage, and documentation so you can focus on higher-impact work.

There are two ways to get started, depending on what works best for your team:

- **Start a 30-day free trial** and set everything up yourself — perfect for smaller teams or hands-on users.
- **For larger teams or more tailored needs, [reach out to the team](https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/joost-boonzajer-flaes/intro-call-docs?uuid=17a4a61f-d0d3-4cbc-9362-56e37483f6f5)** and we'll be happy to help you get started.
