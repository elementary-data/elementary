Welcome to Elementary! Very soon you'll be able to gain source-to-BI observability into your pipeline and:

- Detect issues before they impact downstream assets.
- Guarantee trusted inputs for dashboards, models, and AI workflows.
- Set and enforce compliance and governance policies.
- Make data easy to find, increase adoption, and build trust.
- Use AI agents to automate coverage, triage, documentation, and governance.

There are two ways to get started, depending on what works best for your team:

- **Start a 30-day free trial** and set everything up yourself — perfect for smaller teams or hands-on users.
- **For larger teams or more tailored needs, [book a demo](https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/joost-boonzajer-flaes/intro-call-docs?uuid=17a4a61f-d0d3-4cbc-9362-56e37483f6f5)** and our team will help you get started.

:::note
To use Elementary, you must be a dbt user. We will soon release a Python SDK for any Python pipeline and test.
