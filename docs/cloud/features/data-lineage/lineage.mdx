Elementary offers automated [Column-Level Lineage](/cloud/features/data-lineage/column-level-lineage) functionality, enriched with the latest test and monitors results.
It is built with usability and performance in mind. 
The column-level lineage is built from the metadata of your data warehouse, and integrations with [BI tools](/cloud/features/data-lineage/exposures-lineage#automated-lineage-to-the-bi) such as Looker and Tableau.

Elementary updates your lineage view frequently, ensuring it is always current.
This up-to-date lineage data is essential for supporting several critical workflows, including:

- **Effective Data Issue Debugging**: Identify and trace data issues back to their sources.
- **Incidents impact analysis**: You could explore which downstream assets are impacted by each data issue.
- **Prioritize data issues**: Prioritize the triage and resolution of issues that are impacting your critical downstream assets.
- **Public assets health**: By selecting an exposure and filtering on upstream nodes, you can see the status of all its upstream datasets.
- **Change impact**: Analyze which exposures will be impacted by a planned change.
- **Unused datasets**: Detect datasets that are not consumed downstrean, and could be removed to reduce costs.

## Node info and test results

To view additional information in the lineage view, use the `...` menu to the right of the column:

- **Test results**: Access the table's latest test results in the lineage view.
- **Node info**: See details such as description, owner and tags. If collected, it will include the latest job info.


## Job info in lineage

You can [configure Elementary to collect jobs information](/cloud/guides/collect-job-data) to present in the lineage _Node info_ tab. Job names can also be used to filter the lineage graph.
