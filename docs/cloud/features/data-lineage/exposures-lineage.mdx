Some of your data is used downstream in dashboards, applications, data science pipelines, reverse ETLs, etc.
These downstream data consumers are called _exposures_.

The Elementary lineage graph presents downstream exposures of two origins:

1. Elementary automated BI integrations
2. Exposures configured in your dbt project. Read about [how to configure exposures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/exposures) in code.

<Accordion title="Supported `exposures.yml` fields">

```yaml
exposures:
  - name: returns_dashboard
    label: Returned Orders # Pretty name, will be used if provided
    type: dashboard
    url: https://your.bi.tool/dashboards/2
    description: >
      Returned orders over time
    platform: Tableau # Elementary field
    path: Tableau # For the UI folders tree, elementary field

    depends_on:
      - ref('returned_orders')

### Automated lineage to the BI

<Snippet file="cloud/cloud-feature-tag.mdx" />

Elementary will automatically and continuously extend the column-level lineage to the dashboard level of your data visualization tool.

If your BI tool has its own modeling layers (e.g. data sources in Tableu, Explores in Looker), these will also be included in the graph and column lineage.
