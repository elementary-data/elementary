The **Logs** feature allows workspace admins to track and export both user actions and system-level events across the platform. This includes user configuration changes, data synchronization events, and alert deliveries.

This feature provides visibility into workspace activity and helps support audit readiness, team coordination, operational monitoring, and troubleshooting.

## User Activity Logs

User activity logs track changes made by users across the system, including actions such as creating, editing, or deleting tests, monitors, metadata, and other configurations.

- **Creation, modification, or deletion of configuration**, including:
    - Adding, editing, or deleting tests
    - Adding, editing, deleting, or archiving alert rules
    - Acknowledging, resolving, or assigning incidents
    - Adding, editing, or deleting metadata (owners, descriptions, tags, critical assets)
    - Adding, editing, or deleting integrations
    - Sending team member invites
    - Changing user roles

## System Logs

System logs track system-level events and operations, including data synchronization events and alert deliveries that help with monitoring system operations and troubleshooting.

- **Data synchronization events**, including:
    - Beginning and end of synchronization with dbt
    - Beginning and end of data warehouse (DWH) synchronization
