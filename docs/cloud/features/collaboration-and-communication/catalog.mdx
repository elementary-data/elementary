The Elementary Data Catalog is designed to make a curated collection of datasets easily discoverable by data consumers, along with their dependencies, health status and more.

The Catalog tab provides a comprehensive view of the datasets created for the various analytics teams, enabling easy discovery and access to key metadata for data consumers within your team. It centralizes dataset information, including descriptions, columns, column descriptions, latest update times, and dataset health.

From each dataset, you can navigate directly to its lineage and test results, ensuring seamless exploration of data dependencies and quality insights.
