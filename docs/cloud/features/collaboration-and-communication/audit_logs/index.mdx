The **Logs** feature allows workspace admins to track and export both user actions and system-level events across the platform. This includes user configuration changes, data synchronization events, and alert deliveries.

This feature provides visibility into workspace activity and helps support audit readiness, team coordination, operational monitoring, and troubleshooting.

## Log Types

- **[User Activity Logs](/cloud/features/collaboration-and-communication/audit_logs/user-activity-logs)** - Track changes made by users across the system
- **[System Logs](/cloud/features/collaboration-and-communication/audit_logs/system-logs)** - Track system-level events and operations
