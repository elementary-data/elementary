System logs track system-level events and operations, including data synchronization events and alert deliveries that help with monitoring system operations and troubleshooting.

## What's Included

The system logs capture system-level events and operations across your workspace, including:

- **Data synchronization events**, including:
    - Beginning and end of synchronization with dbt
    - Beginning and end of data warehouse (DWH) synchronization
    - Beginning and end of business intelligence (BI) synchronization
- **Alert deliveries** - When alerts are sent to configured destinations

## Fields

The exported CSV file for system logs includes the following fields:

- **Timestamp** - The date and time when the event occurred (in UTC, ISO 8601 format)
  - *Example:* `"2024-01-15T14:30:45.123456+00:00"`

- **Event Name** - The specific action that was performed
  - *Examples:* `"dbt_data_sync_started"`, `"dbt_data_sync_completed"`, `"dwh_data_sync_started"`, `"dwh_data_sync_completed"`, `"bi_data_sync_started"`, `"bi_data_sync_completed"`, `"alerts_sent"`
  - *Example:* `"dbt_data_sync_completed"` or `"alerts_sent"`

- **Success** - Whether the action completed successfully
  - *Values:* `"True"` or `"False"` (as strings in CSV)
  - *Example:* `"True"` or `"False"`

- **Event Content** - Additional context-specific information about the action (stored as a JSON string)
  - The contents vary by action type. For example:
    - For sync actions: `{"environment_id": "env_789", "environment_name": "Production"}`
    - For alert delivery actions: `{"alert_count": 5, "destination": "slack"}`
  - *Example:* `{"environment_id": "env_789", "environment_name": "Production"}`

- **Env ID** - The environment identifier where the action occurred
  - *Example:* `"env_7890123456abcdef"`

- **Env Name** - The name of the environment where the action occurred
  - *Example:* `"Production"` or `"Staging"`

**Note:** System logs do not include user information fields since they represent automated system operations rather than user-initiated actions.
