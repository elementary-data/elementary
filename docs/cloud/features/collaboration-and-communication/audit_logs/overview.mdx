The **Logs** feature allows workspace admins to track and export both user actions and system-level events across the platform. This includes user configuration changes, data synchronization events, and alert deliveries.

This feature provides visibility into workspace activity and helps support audit readiness, team coordination, operational monitoring, and troubleshooting.

## Log Types

- **[User Activity Logs](/cloud/features/collaboration-and-communication/audit_logs/user-activity-logs)** - Track changes made by users across the system
- **[System Logs](/cloud/features/collaboration-and-communication/audit_logs/system-logs)** - Track system-level events and operations

## How to Access Logs

Once enabled for your account, access the logs:

<Frame>
  <div className="dark:bg-white rounded-md p-4">
    <img
      height ="400"
      width="400"
      src="https://res.cloudinary.com/do5hrgokq/image/upload/v1751204715/logs_fqsfbb.png"
    />
  </div>
</Frame>

1. Click on your **account name** in the top-right corner of the UI
2. Open the dropdown menu
3. Select **Logs**
4. Choose **User Activity Logs** or **System Logs** from the log type selector
5. Select the number of days to look back
6. Click **Export** to download the log as a **CSV file**

You can open the CSV in any spreadsheet tool to review and filter the activity as needed.

## Stream Logs to External Services

In addition to exporting logs as CSV files, you can stream logs in real-time to external log management services for centralized monitoring, analysis, and long-term storage.
