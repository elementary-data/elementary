title: "Roles & Permissions Management"
---

Roles & Permissions management in Elementary lets you control **who can see or do what** inside your account.

Instead of everyone having the same access, you can assign **roles** to users or groups so each person sees only what's relevant to them, and has only the permissions they need.

## Why it matters

- **Security & least privilege** — Users only get access to data and actions required for their role.
- **Team/group separation** — You can separate responsibilities (e.g. analysts, data engineers, reviewers) without interference.
- **Compliance readiness** — With clearly defined roles, you get better traceability for audits and compliance reviews.
- **Flexibility** — permissions are configurable per account, environment, and even per asset/test grouping, so you can support complex org structures.

## How it works in Elementary

| Level | What it controls | Typical use cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Account-level permissions** | **Global account configurations** (e.g. manage users, setup integrations, export audit logs) | Admins, Security / Compliance officers |
| **Environment-level permissions** | Access to **specific environments** (e.g. Prod, Staging).
Access to **environment pages and features** (catalog, lineage, PRs, etc.) | Data teams, Analytics engineers, Data governance |
| **Resources - Asset/Test-level permissions** | Access to **specific group of assets or tests** (e.g. only Marketing datasets, or only domain specific DQ rules) | Scoped analysts / data stewards or domain-specific business users |

A user's effective permissions are the sum (union) of all roles and permissions granted to them.

## Types of Roles

Roles in Elementary can be divided into two categories: built-in (Admin, editor, viewer) and custom.

### **Built-in Roles**

Elementary includes default roles most teams can use immediately - Admin, Editor, Viewer:

| Permissions Level/ Roles | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Account-level permissions** | **Full (Can edit) access for account configurations** (e.g. manage users, setup integrations, export audit logs) | No permissions for account configurations | No permissions for account configurations |
| **Environment-level permissions** | **Full (can edit) access for all environments, pages and features:** Can view and manage any configuration within the environments such as alert rules, manage incidents and PRs, etc. | **Full (can edit) access for all environments, pages and features:** Can view and manage any configuration within the environments such as alert rules, manage incidents and PRs, etc. | **Read only access for all environments:** can view all environments and pages. can't make any changes through the UI. |
| **Resources- Asset/Test-level permissions** | **Full (can edit) access to all assets and tests:** can create/edit assets, run DQ (data-quality) rules, manage pipelines, etc **** | **Full (can edit) access to all assets and tests:** can create/edit assets, run DQ (data-quality) rules, manage pipelines, etc | **Read-only access across data assets and tests:** can browse data assets, lineage, assets' data health, etc. |

These roles cover most organizations, but you can extend them with custom roles.

**Custom Roles**

For each custom rule you can set limited permissions to a subset of environments, pages, or assets/tests (e.g. only Marketing data, or only Prod environments). It's great for domain-specific teams and business users, ensuring each team only has access to the environments, pages, assets and tests relevant to them.
For each role you need to define role Scope (account-level, environment-level, or asset-level) and permissions type (Read only, Can edit, No permissions).

Each role may include permissions at one, two, or all three levels:

1. **Account-Level**
    
    Decide whether the role can **view** and whether it can **edit** account-wide configurations such as user management, integrations, and global configurations.
    
    Without at least **view** permissions, account configurations won't appear for this role.
    
2. **Environment-Level**
    
    By default, any role has access to **all environments**, but you can restrict it to specific ones.
    Choose which environments the role applies to, and what the user can do there.
    
    For each environment:
    
    - **Feature access** — Select which pages (Catalog, Lineage, Alerts, etc.) and features (View/create PRs, AI Agents etc.) are visible.
    - **Permission type** — Set it to **read-only,** **edit** or **No permissions**
3. **Resources filters - Assets & Tests (optional)**
    
    Use metadata filters to restrict the role to specific datasets or tests.
    
    - **Filters** — e.g., `Asset tag = #marketing`, `Test Owner = @data-team`.
    - **Permission type** — Choose read-only or edit access (e.g., create tests, update metadata, modify configurations) for each filter group.

**Custom role example: Marketing analysts**

- Account level - No permissions to view/edit account configuration
- Environment level -
    - For 'Prod' environment
        - Access to pages - Catalog, lineage, data health
        - Permissions type - read only
    - Other environments - No access
- Assets/tests level -
    - `Asset tag = #marketing`  - Can edit
    - `Asset tag = #Sales` - Read only

## Getting started: How to set up role management

1. **Plan your organizational structure**
    - List out personas in your org (e.g. "Data Engineer", "Analyst", "Marketing Analyst", "Business users", "DevOps")
    - For each persona, decide:
        - Whether they need access to **account-level configuration**
        - **Which environments** they should be able to access (e.g., Dev, Staging, Prod)
        - **Which pages, features, and capabilities** they should be able to use (Catalog, Lineage, Alerts, manage tests, update metadata, etc.)
        - **Whether their access should be limited to specific assets or datasets**, using filters such as `Asset tag = #PII` or `Test Owner = @data-team`
2. **Create Custom Roles in Elementary (optional)**
    1. Go to *Settings → Roles,* Click **"Create New Role"**
    2. Set the Role Details - Role name - Give it a clear, descriptive name, such as *Marketing Analyst,  Finance Viewer, Data Steward – Production*
    3. Choose the Role Scope (account-level, environment-level, or asset-level) and permissions type (Read only, can edit)
        
        **Each role may include permissions at one, two, or all three levels.**

3. **Assign Users or Groups to built in or custom Roles**
    - Add individual users or entire groups/teams (via SSO/SCIM integration or manual).
    - Users can have multiple roles, permissions are combined (union).
4. **Adjust and Evolve Roles over time**
    - As your org grows or changes, update role definitions or add new roles (e.g. "IT team", "Business viewer").
    - Reassign or remove roles when people change responsibilities or leave.

## Best Practices & Recommendations

- **Start with broad roles, then narrow down**
    
    Begin with general roles (Admin, Data Engineer, Analyst), then create more scoped roles once patterns emerge (e.g. separate "Marketing Data Viewer," "Finance Data Viewer").
    
- **Use principle of least privilege**
    
    Assign only the minimal permissions required. For example, an analyst who only needs to view data should not have edit or delete permissions.
    
- **Leverage asset/tag-based filters**
    
    Use tags like `tag:#marketing`, `env:prod`, to automatically filter access. This lowers maintenance overhead as you add more assets.
    
- **Regularly review role assignments**
    
    Periodically (e.g. quarterly) run the access snapshot and verify that users still need their assigned roles.
    
- **Avoid giving "Admin" widely**
    
    Reserve account-level Admin or environment-wide write permissions for a small set of trusted users (e.g. data platform or security team).
    

## FAQ

**Q: What happens if a user has two roles with conflicting permissions (e.g. one role gives "read-only", another gives "edit")?**

A: Elementary uses a **union model** — the user gets the higher privilege. So in that case, they'd have "edit" access.

**Q: Can I let someone see only a subset of datasets (e.g. only marketing data)?**

A: Yes. When you create/edit a role, you can specify asset filters (e.g. by tag, owner, or dataset name). That way, scoped viewers or editors only see their allowed subset.

**Q: What if I need a temporary elevated permission for a user (e.g. for a one-time task)?**

A: You can assign a role temporarily (for example, a "Contractor – Write Access" role), and remove it once the task is done. We recommend logging the change and reviewing it later.

**Q: Does using Roles & Permissions affect performance or data loading?**

A: No — permissions are enforced efficiently at request time. There is no perceptible performance overhead under normal usage.

**Q: Can I export or audit roles and permissions?**

A: Yes — Elementary provides **Roles Audit Logs** that record all role changes and assignments. You can export to CSV or share with compliance teams.
