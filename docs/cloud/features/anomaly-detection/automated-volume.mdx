The volume monitor tracks the **total row count** of a table over time, rather than individual table updates. 
This means that Elementary will not consider a single update as anomalous, but rather a continuous anomalous trend occurring over a period of time.

### Understand the monitor result

The test data set is divided into two periods -

1. Training Period - The historical behavior of the table's volume, patterns, and so forth. By default it will include 21 days.
2. Detection Period - This is the period within which we look for anomalies. By default itâ€™s set to the last 48 hours.

Data points and expected range - 
- Data points within the training period are dark grey, and data points within the detection period are colored.
- The light grey area around the data points represents the model expected range. Data points outside this range are considered anomalous.
- Hovering over a data point will detail the row count timestamp, row count and expected range. 

Use the `Anomaly settings` and `result feedback` buttons to impact the monitor.
