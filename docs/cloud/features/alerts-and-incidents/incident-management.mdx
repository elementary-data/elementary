The `Incidents` page is designed to enable your team to stay on top of open incidents and collaborate on resolving them.
The page gives a comprehensive overview of all current and previous incidents, where users can view the status, prioritize, assign and resolve incidents.

## Incidents view and filters

The page provides a view of all incidents, and useful filters:

- **Quick Filters:** Preset quick filters for all, unresolved and “open and unassigned” incidents.
- **Filter:** Allows users to filter incidents based on various criteria such as status, severity, model name and assignee.
- **Time frame:** Filter incidents which were open in a certain timeframe.

## Interacting with Incidents

An incident has a status, assignee and severity.
These can be set in the Incidents page, or from an alert in integrations that support alert actions.

- **Incident status**: Will be set to `open` by default, and can be changed to `Acknowledged` and back to `Open`. When an alert is manually or automatically set as `Resolved`, it will close and will no longer be modified.
- **Incident assignee**: An incident can be assigned to any user on the team, and they will be notified.
    - If you assign an incident to a user, it is recommended to leave the incident `Open` until the user changes status to `Acknowledged`.
- **Incident severity**: Severity of an incident can be Low, Normal, High or Critical. By default, model errors are set to Critical, test failures set to High and warnings are marked as Normal, but the severity can be changed manually.  _Coming soon_ : Severity will be automated by an analysis of the impacted assets.

<Note> Incident severity is used to prioritize incidents and to set the urgency of resolving them. it is not the same as dbt test severity </Note>

## Incidents overview and metrics

The incidents are divided into categories based on their status, and the user can view the number of incidents in each category by severity.
For resolved incidents, the user can view the average resolution time.

_Coming soon_ : The option to create and share a periodic summary of incidents will be supported in the future.
