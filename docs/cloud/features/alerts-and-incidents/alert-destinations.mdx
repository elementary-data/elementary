The Alert Destinations tab helps you control where alerts are sent for each test, directly from the test configuration page or the test side panel.

This makes it easy to understand how alerts are routed, reduce noise, and manage settings without switching contexts.

## What You Can See

The **Alert Destinations** tab provides a detailed view of your alerting setup for each test, including:

- A list of your tests, along with their **assigned destinations**, highlighting both active configurations and any gaps in your alerting strategy
- The **current destinations** where alerts are being sent, and how many tests are being assigned for each one
- The **routing method** used for each alert: whether it’s defined by an **alert rule**, a **custom configuration**, or set directly in **code**
- The **alert status** for each test—clearly indicates whether alerts are **enabled** or **disabled**

You’ll have full visibility into how alerts for a specific test are managed.

## What You Can Do

- **Enable or disable alerts** for individual tests or in bulk
- **Override alert destinations** in bulk for faster configuration updates **(Coming Soon)**

This feature makes it easier to manage alert delivery and ensure alerts are routed as expected, especially across different teams or test types.
