The **Test Coverage screen** in the Elementary Cloud [catalog](/cloud/features/collaboration-and-communication/catalog) gives you a full picture of your data quality coverage across assets and dimensions. It’s designed to help you quickly understand where you stand and take action to improve.

## What It Shows

Each asset is evaluated across **seven data quality dimensions**:

- **Freshness**
- **Completeness**
- **Uniqueness**
- **Validity**
- **Accuracy**
- **Consistency**
- **Other**

For each asset, you’ll see:

- **Which dimensions are covered** by existing tests
- **Where coverage is missing**
- [A **coverage score** between **0–100%**](docs/cloud/features/data-tests/test-coverage-screen#how-coverage-calculation-works).
- **Links to test results**

## What You Can Do from This Screen

From the Test Coverage screen, you can:

- Filters by asset properties, test name, critical assets, and coverage ranges.
- **Select multiple assets and seamlessly add your missing tests with just a few clicks**
- **Jump directly to any asset in the catalog to review its details**
- Gain insight into gaps by grouping assets across dimensions like domain, pipeline, tag, or owner—making weak spots easy to identify. (Coming soon)
- Export the results to CSV

## How Coverage Calculation Works

The **test coverage score** is calculated based on **7 dimensions of data quality**. 
The first **6 core dimensions** each contribute **15%** to the total score. The **7th dimension**, labeled **“Other,”** accounts for the remaining **10%** and is primarily used for **business logic tests** that don’t align directly with any specific core dimension.

### Upcoming Features

- **Customizable Weights:**
    
    You’ll soon be able to tailor the weighting of each dimension to align with your organization’s unique priorities and testing standards.
    
- **Custom Coverage Rules:**
    
    Define your own coverage criteria to better identify tables that do not meet your internal standards. This will make it easier to spot gaps and maintain consistent data quality practices.

## Test Recommendation AI Agent

Alongside the Test Coverage screen, you can also use our [**Test Recommendation Agent**](https://docs.elementary-data.com/cloud/ai-agents/test-recommendation-agent) to help you improve test coverage.

Together, the coverage screen and the agent give you visibility and guidance to focus your efforts where they’ll have the most impact.
