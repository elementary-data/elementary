### Closed beta - Elementary Pull request impact analysis!

When making changes to your data project, it can sometimes be hard to fully understand the impact of your changes and be certain that there are no unintended consequences.

Our impact analysis will run on every pull request in your dbt project, so that you can see the downstream impact of your changes.
You'll also be able to see if any of your dbt tests are failing or your models aren't being built successfully.

Elementary CI automations help you make changes with confidence by providing a comprehensive view before merging your pull request.
