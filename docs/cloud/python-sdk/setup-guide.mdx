This guide walks you through installing and configuring the Elementary Python SDK to report assets, test results, and execution metadata from your Python pipelines.

## Installation

The Python SDK is installed via pip. Installation instructions and package requirements will be provided when you get access to the beta.

## Configuration

The Python SDK requires configuration to connect to your Elementary Cloud environment. You'll need:

1. **Elementary Cloud API Key** - Get this from your Elementary Cloud account settings
2. **Environment ID** - Your Elementary environment identifier

Configuration can be done via environment variables or a configuration file, similar to how the Elementary CLI is configured.

## Basic Concepts

The SDK is designed to work with any Python testing framework. The core functionality includes:

- **Reporting assets** - Tables, files, vector stores, or any data entity produced by your Python pipeline
- **Reporting test results** - Results from any testing framework (Great Expectations, pytest, custom frameworks, etc.)
- **Tracking execution metadata** - Pipeline runs, timing, status, and errors
- **Reporting lineage** - Connecting Python assets to upstream and downstream dependencies

## Integration with Existing Frameworks

The SDK works with any Python testing framework. You can wrap your existing tests to report results to Elementary without changing your test logic:

- **Great Expectations** - Report GE validation results
- **Pytest** - Report pytest test outcomes
- **Custom frameworks** - Report results from any homegrown testing solution
- **DQX and other tools** - The SDK is framework-agnostic

## Reporting Execution Metadata

Track pipeline execution details including:
- Pipeline name and environment
- Start and end times
- Duration
- Success/failure status
- Error messages and stack traces

## Reporting Lineage

Connect your Python assets to upstream and downstream dependencies, creating a complete lineage graph that includes:
- Python pipeline outputs
- dbt models
- Warehouse tables
- Unstructured data sources
- Vector stores
- ML model outputs
