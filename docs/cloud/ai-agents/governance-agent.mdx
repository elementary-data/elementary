**Governing your data isn’t just about internal organization, it’s the key to making your data reliably usable by both humans and AI.** 

The Governance Agent helps you scale and maintain trusted, well-documented data assets without manual effort. It evaluates your metadata, identifies gaps, and suggests improvements, all based on how your organization already tags, documents, and assigns ownership. 

By learning from your environment’s existing conventions, the agent brings consistency, policy enforcement, and AI-readiness across your pipelines.

### **Using the Governance Agent**

You can trigger the Governance Agent from the Catalog screen, and ask it a question like **"Which tables in the marketing domain are missing ownership?"**. It will analyze the asset’s metadata and context, validate it against both best practices and your custom policies, and generate a list of actionable suggestions. When you’re ready, the agent can open a pull request with the proposed metadata changes.

### Key Capabilities

### Learns from Your Environment

The agent understands and scales your internal standards by analyzing:

- Tag structures and naming conventions
- Ownership assignments
- Folder hierarchies and asset types
- Custom metadata fields already in use

This ensures all recommendations align with your existing governance style — not just a static set of rules.

### Validates Governance Coverage

The agent identifies:

- Missing or inconsistent documentation for tables, columns, and BI assets
- Unassigned or conflicting owners
- Gaps in classification, tags, or custom metadata
- Sensitive data fields that aren’t properly flagged or controlled

### Metadata Enrichment

The agent suggests or autofills:

- Table and column descriptions
- Tags and classifications
- Ownership fields
- Custom metadata based on known structures

### Sensitive Data Enforcement

Sensitive fields are automatically detected and checked to ensure appropriate tagging is applied, and that there's no propagation to unauthorized downstream assets

### Pull Request Automation

Once suggested changes are ready, the agent will open a **pull request** for you to review and apply.

### Who It’s For

Built for **data platform teams, analytics engineers, and governance leads** who want to increase metadata coverage, enforce governance policies, and ensure their data is ready for AI, without adding manual overhead.
