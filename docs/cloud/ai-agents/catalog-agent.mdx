**The Catalog Agent helps data analysts, business users, and downstream AI tools discover the most relevant and trustworthy data assets, without relying on technical teams to guide every decision.**

By interpreting natural language questions and surfacing the right context—including data health, lineage, and metric definitions—it enables faster, more confident access to the data people need. The agent acts as an intelligent layer on top of your catalog, making your data more accessible, explainable, and AI-ready.

By enriching data with structure, health signals, and semantic context, the Catalog Agent lays the groundwork for more accurate and effective AI-powered workflows across your organization.

### Using the Catalog Agent

Open the Catalog Agent to start a conversation. Just ask a question like **“Which table should I use to analyze user retention?”** or **“Can I trust the orders table?”** and the agent will guide you to the right assets or insights.

It will:

- Interpret your request using metadata, lineage, and semantic context
- Suggest relevant datasets, tables, or metrics
- Surface freshness, incident status, and test results
- Explain how the data is used and whether it can be trusted

The Catalog Agent supports both human users and other AI systems in navigating your data with clarity and confidence.

### Key Capabilities

### Intelligent Discovery

Helps users find the right data using:

- Metadata such as tags, descriptions, owners, and usage patterns
- Lineage to understand dependencies and impact
- Semantic layers *(coming soon)* from dbt, BI tools, or external catalogs for metric-level context

### Trust and Quality Signals

For every asset, the agent provides real-time indicators of reliability:

- Freshness metrics
- Open incidents and recent test results
- A high-level trust signal based on metadata coverage and data health

### Who It’s For

The Catalog Agent is built for **data analysts**, **business users**, **AI copilots**, and **intelligent applications** that need to find and understand the right data without making the data team a bottleneck.
