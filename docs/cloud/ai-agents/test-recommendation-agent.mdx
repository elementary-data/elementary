**Make sure you're covered—not by how many tests you write, but by how many problems you catch.** The Test Coverage Agent helps you achieve meaningful, consistent test coverage across your data pipelines, without the manual overhead.

It analyzes your data model, usage patterns, lineage, and existing tests to recommend what to test and where. It adapts to your team's style, reduces alert fatigue, and preserves consistency across your test suite. The result is higher data quality, fewer blind spots, and more time focused on building—not debugging.

### Using the Test Coverage Agent

Open the agent to review test coverage across your assets. It evaluates each asset's purpose, type, criticality, and usage, along with its metadata, lineage, and current test suite. It then recommends new tests, identifies redundant or low-impact ones, and suggests configuration changes to reduce noise.

You can review and approve the recommendations in one click. The agent will automatically open a pull request with the proposed changes, that are aligned with your team’s existing test patterns and structure. You can also provide input to customize the recommendations before applying them.

### Key Capabilities

### Coverage Analysis and Test Recommendations

The agent analyzes assets individually and in context, taking into account lineage, metadata, SQL logic, and usage, to identify where coverage is missing or misaligned. It suggests new tests based on best practices and your team’s existing style, and (coming soon) your own test policy configuration.

### Fatigue Reduction

The agent flags tests that are overly noisy, ineffective, or no longer relevant, and helps tune configurations to make your test suite more reliable and actionable.

### Automated Implementation

Once you're satisfied with the recommendations, the agent opens a pull request with all changes. You stay in control, but no longer have to do everything manually.

### Who It’s For

Built for **analytics engineers and data engineers** who want to improve test coverage intelligently, avoid alert fatigue, and maintain high data quality without slowing down development.
