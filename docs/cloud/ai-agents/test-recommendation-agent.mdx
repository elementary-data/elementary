**Make sure you’re covered—not by how many tests you write, but by how many problems you catch.** The Test Recommendation Agent analyzes your data asset, metadata, lineage, and existing test suite to suggest high-impact tests that match your team’s style and priorities.

It helps you expand meaningful coverage, reduce alert fatigue, and maintain a reliable test strategy as your pipelines evolve.

### Using the Test Recommendation Agent
Open the agent from the test configuration screen and ask a question like **"What tests can ensure all of my customer data is up to date?"** or **"Which upstream tables need tests to protect my revenue dashboard?"**. The agent generates recommendations based on asset type, criticality, lineage, and your existing test configurations. You can approve, adjust, or skip suggestions as needed. Once approved, the agent opens a pull request with changes that follow your team’s current test structure.

### Key Capabilities

### Coverage Analysis and Test Recommendations

The agent analyzes assets individually and in context, taking into account lineage, metadata, SQL logic, and usage, to identify where coverage is missing or misaligned. It suggests new tests based on best practices and your team’s existing style, and (coming soon) your own test policy configuration.

### Fatigue Reduction

The agent flags tests that are overly noisy, ineffective, or no longer relevant, and helps tune configurations to make your test suite more reliable and actionable.

### Automated Implementation

Once you're satisfied with the recommendations, the agent opens a pull request with all changes. You stay in control, but no longer have to do everything manually.

### Who It’s For

Built for **analytics engineers and data engineers** who want to improve test coverage intelligently, avoid alert fatigue, and maintain high data quality without slowing down development.
