**Automates root cause analysis, clarifies the impact, and suggests actionable fixes so you spend less time triaging and more time solving what matters.** The result is a shift from manual investigation to a faster, more focused workflow, allowing you to focus on delivering business value rather than fighting fires.

Whether it's a failed test, a model issue, or an unexpected anomaly, it inspects recent code changes, execution history, lineage, and, when allowed, the data itself. It prioritizes the incidents that matter, proposes a fix, and can open a pull request for you. That way, incidents stop slowing you down, and pipelines begin to fix themselves.

## Using the Triage & Resolution agent

From the Incident Management screen click **“Investigate with AI”** to trigger the agent. It will begin analyzing the incident and surface insights. You can follow along, ask clarifying questions, and when you're ready, allow the agent to open a pull request with its suggested fix - all within your review flow.

## Key Capabilities

### Automated Root Cause Investigation

The agent dives deep into each incident to uncover why it happened. It inspects:

- **Recent code changes**, including relevant commits and pull requests.
- **Historical executions** of the pipeline or asset.
- **Upstream lineage**, to detect whether the issue originated from a dependency.
- **The data itself** (when allowed), including the affected asset and its related tables.

### Impact Clarification

It doesn’t stop at what’s broken, it tells you **what’s affected**:

- Analyzes **downstream dependencies** to understand the blast radius.
- Validates whether **data products, dashboards, metrics**, or **AI applications** are impacted.

### Incident Prioritization

Each issue is automatically ranked by the downstream dependencies impact, and the criticality of the affected asset.

This helps your team know what to focus on, and what can wait. 

### Automated Remediation (Where Possible)

Once the problem is identified, the agent can:

- Recommend **concrete steps to fix** the issue.
- Automatically **open a pull request** with proposed changes.
- (Coming soon) **Notify stakeholders** affected by the issue.

## Who It’s For

Designed for **hands-on data professionals**, including data engineers, analytics engineers, and platform teams, who need a faster, more reliable way to stay on top of incidents without getting buried in triage work.
