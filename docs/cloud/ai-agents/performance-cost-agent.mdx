_Coming soon!_

**Optimize long-running queries, eliminate performance bottlenecks, and reduce costs—without combing through logs or rewriting SQL by hand.** The Performance and Cost Agent helps you identify inefficiencies in your pipelines and fix them quickly, so your data stays fresh, fast, and within budget.

By improving query speed and resource usage, this agent plays a critical role in helping teams meet data SLAs and ensure that products, dashboards, and AI models get updated data on time.

### Using the Performance and Cost Agent

You can trigger the agent from a slow or costly query, or from any asset flagged as underperforming. It analyzes the logic of the query by looking at the SQL itself, the surrounding metadata, and the historical performance profile.

From there, the agent suggests targeted optimizations—both in the query code and in the configuration of resource-intensive steps. It estimates potential savings in runtime and cost, so you can see the impact before applying changes. Once you're ready, the agent can open a pull request with its proposed improvements and iterate further until the pipeline meets your performance goals.

### Key Capabilities

### Performance Diagnostics and Optimization

The agent evaluates:

- Query logic and structure
- Historical execution time and resource usage
- Metadata context and lineage

It uses that analysis to identify performance bottlenecks and propose:

- Code-level SQL optimizations
- Resource allocation and configuration changes
- Structural improvements that reduce load or complexity

### Cost and SLA Awareness

Each recommendation includes an estimate of:

- Time saved per run
- Cost reduction per run or per day
- Impact on data freshness and downstream data availability

This makes it easier to prioritize which performance issues are worth fixing and why.

### Automated Implementation and Iteration

Once recommendations are approved, the agent opens a pull request with the proposed changes. It can continue to iterate based on updated performance feedback until the asset meets defined SLAs or cost targets.

### Who It’s For

Built for **analytics engineers and data engineers** who need to improve pipeline speed, reduce costs, and ensure data products stay fresh and reliable without getting buried in manual query tuning.
