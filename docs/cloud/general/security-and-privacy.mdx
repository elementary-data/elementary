## Security highlights

Our product is designed with security and compliance in mind.

- Elementary Cloud does not have read access to raw data in your data warehouse.
- Elementary Cloud only extracts and stores metadata, logs and aggregated metrics.
- All data is encrypted at rest and in transit using industry standard protocols.
- Elementary uses service accounts or authentication tokens with granular and minimal permissions.
- Elementary offers deployment options with no direct access from Elementary Cloud to your data warehouse and third-party tools.

## Security principals

Elementary Cloud is designed with the core principle of least privilege.
Our cloud service does not require permissions to access the customer data.
Therefore, we instruct our customers to create a dedicated role for Elementary with `read only` access only to the Elementary schema in your data warehouse.

As long as you follow the onboarding process instructions, it will be impossible for Elementary Cloud to read data from your warehouse that does not reside in the Elementary schema.
This ensures that Elementary cloud will not mistakenly access your data, and minimizes the risk in case of a data breach.
Our product and architecture are always evolving, but our commitment to secure design always remains.

## How it works?

1. You install the Elementary dbt package in your dbt project and configure it to write to it's own schema, the Elementary schema.
2. The package writes test results, run results, logs and metadata to the Elementary schema.
3. The cloud service only requires `read access` to the Elementary schema, not to schemas where your sensitive data is stored.
4. The cloud service connects to sync the Elementary schema using an **encrypted connection** and a **static IP address** that you will need to add to your allowlist.

## What information does Elementary collect?

Elementary collects and stores metadata, aggregated metrics and logs.
The collected information is detailed in the table below.

You can see all the data that Elementary collects and stores in your local Elementary schema.

In general, Elementary does not collect any raw data. The only exception is the failed rows sample (stored in table `test_results_samples`) which can be disabled.
This is an opt-out feature that shows a sample of a few raw failed rows for failed tests, to help users triage and understand the problem.
To avoid this sampling, set the var `test_sample_row_count: 0` in your `dbt_project.yml` (default is 5 sample rows).

## Secrets and encryption

- **Tokens and credentials** - For customer secrets (tokens and credentials) we use [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html). Secrets Manager uses envelope encryption with AWS KMS keys and data keys to protect each secret value. Whenever the secret value in a secret changes, Secrets Manager generates a new data key to protect it. The data key is encrypted under a KMS key and stored in the metadata of the secret. [See this link for more details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html).
- **Customer data (Elementary schema replica)** - The synced customer data is encrypted at rest using server-side encryption (AES-256).
- **Network connections** - All connections to Elementary Cloud are encrypted by default, in both directions using modern ciphers and cryptographic systems. We encrypt in transit utilizing TLS 1.2. Any attempt to connect over HTTP is redirected to HTTPS.
