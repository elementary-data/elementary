This is full list of tools currently exposed by the Elementary MCP Server.

These tools allow agents and interfaces to retrieve information from your Elementary environment, such as models, tests, lineage, incidents, and coverage, in a structured and consistent way.

You won’t need to use these tools directly. They’re used behind the scenes by any MCP-compatible client.

| **Category** | **Tool Name** | **Purpose** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Discovery & Lineage** | `get_asset` | When you need info about any asset type, from source to BI (table assets, BI assets) | Complete asset details with general information |
|  | `get_upstream_assets` | When investigating data lineage or debugging issues upstream | Asset dependencies with metadata (id, name, type, criticality, tags, owners, description, path) |
|  | `get_downstream_assets` | When assessing impact of changes or understanding data consumers | Asset dependencies with metadata (id, name, type, criticality, tags, owners, description, path) |
|  | `get_column_upstream_columns` | When tracing column-level lineage for specific data fields | Column dependencies with their metadata (id, name, type, table info) |
|  | `get_column_downstream_columns` | When understanding column usage and impact analysis | Column dependencies with their metadata (id, name, type, table info) |
|  | `get_table_asset` | When you need table-specific details like schema, columns, and tests | Table asset with columns, materialization, execution status, and associated tests |
|  | `get_table_assets` | When searching for tables by name, tags, owners, or other criteria | List of table assets matching filter criteria |
|  | `get_table_asset_compiled_query` | When you need to see the actual SQL code being executed | Compiled SQL query from the latest execution |
|  | `get_table_asset_execution_history` | When investigating table execution patterns or failures over time | Historical execution records with timestamps and status |
|  | `get_table_asset_execution` | When debugging a specific table execution failure | Detailed execution logs, timing, and error information |
| **Test & Coverage** | `get_assets_sorted_by_coverage` | When prioritizing which assets need more test coverage | Assets ranked by test coverage percentage |
|  | `get_test` | When investigating test configuration or recent test results | Test details including config, execution status, and quality dimensions |
|  | `get_tests` | When searching for tests by name, type, or asset association | List of tests matching filter criteria |
|  | `get_test_execution_metrics` | When analyzing specific test failure metrics that caused anomaly | Test execution results, numerical metrics, and anomaly details |
|  | `get_test_execution_history` | When reviewing test performance patterns over time | Historical test execution records and results |
|  | `get_test_execution` | When debugging a specific test execution failure | Detailed test execution logs, results, and error information |
|  | `get_tests_catalog` | When helping users add tests to their dbt project | Available test types that can be defined in the dbt project |
| **Incidents** | `get_incidents` | When searching for incidents by time range, status, severity, or assignee | List of incidents with timing, assignee, status, severity, tags, and ticket information |
|  | `get_incident` | When investigating details of a specific incident | Complete incident details including source asset/test information and execution context |
|  | `get_asset_incidents_history` | When reviewing past incident patterns for a specific asset | Historical incident records for an asset with status and timing |
| **Environment Management** | `get_environments` | When starting a session to discover available data environments | Dictionary mapping environment IDs to environment names |
