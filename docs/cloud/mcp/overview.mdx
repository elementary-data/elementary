The Elementary MCP Server allows you to connect your Elementary environment to any client that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol). This lets AI agents, copilots, or natural language interfaces query and act on your data stack using live context.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol introduced by Anthropic. It defines a way for AI systems to retrieve context and trigger actions from external tools in a structured way.

The Elementary MCP Server exposes an interface to query key parts of your data environment — including:

- Models
- Tests
- Incidents
- Test coverage
- Lineage (dbt + BI), including column-level
- Incidents

This enables workflows like:

- Asking “What’s the status of the model feeding the revenue dashboard?”
- Automatically creating a freshness test for a column
- Browsing lineage to find upstream causes of issues
- Triggering updates or syncs without opening a UI

## How it works

The MCP Server runs as a remote service and is exposed via a single authenticated endpoint. It is compatible with any MCP-enabled client, such as Claude, Cursor IDE and Custom agents and LLM copilots.

## Supported operations
