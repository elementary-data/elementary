This document walks you through connecting any MCP‑compatible client (Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code, and others) to **Elementary’s production remote MCP server**. It covers prerequisites, installation of the `mcp-remote` helper, authentication, and per‑client configuration steps.

## Prerequisites
| Requirement | Why it’s needed |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Node.js 18 LTS or newer** | `mcp-remote` (and many editors) run via `npx`, which depends on Node. Verify with `node --version`. |
| **npm / npx** | Bundled with Node; `npx` fetches `mcp-remote` on demand. |
---

## 1 – Install `mcp-remote`
For one‑off use, you can rely on `npx` to auto‑download the package each time:
```bash
npx -y mcp-remote --help
```
To avoid first‑run latency (or to pin a version) install globally:
```bash
npm install -g mcp-remote@latest
```
---
## 2 – Generate a personal access token
**Design Partner Stage:** Personal access tokens are currently available to design partners only. To obtain a token, please reach out to the Elementary team and we'll provide you with one manually.
**Coming soon:** Self-service token management will be available directly from the Elementary UI for all users.
Elementary issues **user‑scoped bearer tokens**.  
These tokens inherit **your** workspace permissions:
* Treat them like passwords – **do not share or commit** them.  
* Rotate regularly.  
* Revoke immediately if compromised.
---
## 3 – Universal configuration JSON
Insert the block below into your client’s MCP configuration file, replacing `...` with your token:
```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "elementary-remote": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",                              // auto‑install if missing
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://prod.api.elementary-data.com/mcp/",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AUTH_TOKEN": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**Why the `-y` flag?**  
It makes `npx` skip the interactive “install this package?” prompt.

## 4 – Client‑specific steps
### 4.1 Cursor IDE
1. **Settings → Model Context Protocol → Add Custom Server**  
   or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) / `<project>/.cursor/mcp.json` (workspace).
2. Paste the JSON above.
3. Save – Cursor auto‑restarts its MCP agent.
### 4.2 Claude Desktop
1. In the menu bar choose **Claude → Developer Settings** to enable advanced configuration.
2. Edit `claude_desktop_config.json`  
   * macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
   * Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Paste the JSON block and **restart Claude**. A hammer icon confirms the server is active.
### 4.3 Visual Studio Code (GitHub Copilot Chat ≥ v1.102)
1. **Command Palette → MCP: Open User Configuration**  
   _or_ create `.vscode/mcp.json` inside your workspace.
2. Paste the JSON block.
3. Reload the window; run **MCP: Show Installed Servers** to verify.
---
## 5 – Verify connectivity
```bash
npx mcp-remote https://prod.api.elementary-data.com/mcp/ \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" --health
```
`200 OK` confirms the endpoint and token are valid.
---
## 6 – Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Remedy |
|---------|--------|
| `node: command not found` | Install Node ≥ 18 and ensure it’s on `PATH`. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Token expired or pasted incorrectly → regenerate. |
---
### Security reminders
* Tokens confer **all** your Elementary permissions.  
* Keep them secret and scoped; rotate when in doubt.  
* Revoke compromised tokens immediately.
