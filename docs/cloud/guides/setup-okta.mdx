## Authentication & SSO Integrationfir

### Supported Authentication Protocols

Elementary Cloud supports **Okta Single Sign-On (SSO)** via multiple authentication protocols:

- **SAML 2.0** (Security Assertion Markup Language)
- **OIDC (OpenID Connect)**

These protocols enable seamless authentication, reducing the need for manual credential management.

### SCIM for Automated Provisioning

Elementary Cloud supports **SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)** for automated user provisioning and deprovisioning:

- **Automated User Creation**: Users added in Okta can be provisioned automatically in Elementary Cloud.
- **Deprovisioning Support**: When a user is removed from Okta, their access to Elementary Cloud is revoked automatically.
- **Group-Based Provisioning**: Okta groups can be mapped to roles in Elementary Cloud by the Elementary team.

For more details on SCIM setup, refer to Okta’s SCIM integration guide: [Okta SCIM Guide](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_scim.htm).

## Security & Access Control

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Elementary Cloud does not enforce MFA directly, but any MFA policies configured through Okta will automatically apply once Okta SSO is enabled.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Group Sync

- Supports **RBAC with predefined roles** (**Admin, Can Write, Can Read**).
- **Role mappings for group names** can be pre-defined if sent in advance.
- **Role Assignment**:
  - The account creator will have a default **Admin** role.
  - For provisioned users, If no configuration is made, the **default role will be Can Read**.
  - Manually invited users will have the role defined during the invite process.
  - **Custom roles** are currently not supported.



## How to Set Up Okta SSO for Elementary Cloud

### Step 1: Create a Custom App in Okta

1. Navigate to **Okta Admin Dashboard** > **Applications**.
2. Click **Create App Integration** and select **SAML 2.0**.
3. Configure the following settings:
    - **Single Sign-On URL**: `https://elementary-data.frontegg.com/auth/saml/callback`
    - **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: `elementary`
4. Obtain the **Okta IdP Metadata and SAML Signing Certificates** as an **XML file**.
5. Share the **XML file** with Elementary Cloud Support to complete the integration.

### Step 2: Verify Integration with Elementary Cloud

- Once the XML file is shared, Elementary Cloud will complete the integration setup.
- We recommend scheduling a **real-time verification call** to ensure everything is working before making the setting permanent.



## How to Set Up SCIM for Automated Provisioning

### Step 1: Configure SCIM in Okta

1. Go to **Okta Admin Dashboard** > **Applications**.
2. Locate the **Elementary Cloud app** and open it.
3. Navigate to the **Provisioning tab** and enable **SCIM provisioning**.
4. Enter the following details:
    - **SCIM Provisioning URL**: *(See internal 1Password for details)*
    - **Authorization Token**: *(See internal 1Password for details)*
5. Save the settings and test provisioning by adding a test user.

### Step 2: Define Role Mapping

- By default, users are assigned the **Can Read** role.
- The default role can be changed to **Can Write** or **Admin**.
- Okta group names can be mapped to specific roles upon request.
