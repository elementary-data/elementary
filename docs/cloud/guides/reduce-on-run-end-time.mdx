## Next Steps

After configuring your on-run-end hooks timing:

1. **Set up metadata sync schedule**: If you disabled autoupload, create a process (manual or recurring job, e.g., daily) to sync metadata when your project changes
2. **Configure sync scheduling**: Set up webhook-triggered syncs for real-time updates. See the [Sync Scheduling guide](/cloud/guides/sync-scheduling) for details
3. **Monitor data completeness**: Verify that Elementary Cloud still receives the data needed for your monitoring use cases
