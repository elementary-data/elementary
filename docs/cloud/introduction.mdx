## How does it work?

The Elementary dbt package runs as part of your dbt invocations.
The package collects and stores data such as run results, test results, anomaly detection results and more.

This data is saved to an Elementary schema in the DWH.
The Elementary cloud service requires access only to this schema, to connect and generates a report UI and Slack alerts.
