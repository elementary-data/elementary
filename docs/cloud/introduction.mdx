**Elementary is a data observability platform tailored for dbt first data organizations.**

The unique dbt-native architecture seamlessly integrates into engineers' workflows, ensuring ease of use and smooth adoption. 
The platform provides out-of-the-box monitoring for critical issues, tools to effortlessly increase coverage, and integrations for end-to-end visibility across the data stack.

Elementary promotes ownership and collaboration on incidents, and enables the whole data organization to take an active role in the data quality process.
By automatically measuring and tracking data health, it helps teams transition from reactive firefighting to proactively communicating data health to consumers and stakeholders.

## Cloud Platform Features

### Detection & Coverage

Elementary integrates powerful anomaly detection and dbt tests into a unified detection strategy. 
Effective data issues detection requires a comprehensive approach, 
including both pipeline and data monitoring, validation tests, 
anomaly detection for unexpected behavior, and a single interface to manage it all at scale.
