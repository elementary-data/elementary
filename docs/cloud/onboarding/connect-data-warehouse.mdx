You can connect Elementary to a data warehouse that has an Elementary schema (created by the [Elementary dbt package](/cloud/onboarding/quickstart-dbt-package)).

Elementary Cloud needs:
- [`profiles.yml`](/cloud/onboarding/create-profile) with connection details
- Read permissions to the Elementary schema (and not the rest of your data)
- Network access (might require to allowlist Elementary IP address)

### Connect Elementary cloud

On the `Account settings` under `Integrations`, press `Connect` on the "Connect Your data warehouse" section.

Provide an environment name, select a data warehouse type, and upload the `profiles.yml` file with the `elementary` profile.


### Allowlist Elementary IP

Elementary IP for allowlist: `3.126.156.226`
