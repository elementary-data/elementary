sidebarTitle: "2. Create profiles.yml"

You will need to provide Elementary cloud a `profiles.yml` file with a connection profile named `elementary`.

- The profile needs to point at the database and schema name where your elementary tables are.
- The provided credentials need to have read permissions to the elementary schema.

The easiest way to generate the profile is:
1. Run the following command in the dbt project where elementary dbt package is deployed (works in dbt cloud as well):

```shell
dbt run-operation elementary.generate_elementary_cli_profile
```

2. Copy and save the output to a `profiles.yml` file, update the missing details, and you are ready.

### Permissions and security

**Elementary cloud doesn't need permissions to your sensitive data.**

It is recommended to create a read only user for the elementary schema only, and provide it to Elementary Cloud in the profile.
For more details, refer to [security and privacy](/cloud/security-and-privacy).

### `profiles.yml` examples

Here is the format of `profiles.yml` for each supported data warehouse:

<CodeGroup>

```yml Snowflake
## SNOWFLAKE ##
## Configure the database and schema of elementary models.

elementary:
  outputs:
    default:
      type: snowflake
      account: [account id]

      ## User/password auth ##
      user: [username]
      password: [password]

      role: [user role]
      database: [database name]
      warehouse: [warehouse name]
      schema: [schema name]_elementary
      threads: 4

```

```yml BigQuery
## BIGQUERY ##
## Configure the database and schema of elementary models. 

elementary:
  outputs:
    default:
      type: bigquery

      ## Service account auth ##
      method: service-account
      keyfile: empty

      project: [project id]
      dataset: [dataset name] # elementary dataset, usually [dataset name]_elementary
      threads: 4

      dbname: [database name]
      schema: [schema name] # elementary schema, usually [schema name]_elementary
      threads: 4
```

```yml Databricks
## DATABRICKS ##
## Configure the database and schema of elementary models.

elementary:
  outputs:
    default:
      type: databricks
      host: [hostname, like <ID>.cloud.databricks.com]
      http_path: [like /sql/1.0/endpoints/<ID>]
      schema: [schema name] # elementary schema, usually [schema name]_elementary
      token: [token]
      threads: [number of threads like 8]
```

```yml Postgres
## POSTGRES ##
## Configure the database and schema of elementary models.

elementary:
  outputs:
