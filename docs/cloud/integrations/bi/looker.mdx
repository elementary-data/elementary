In order to allow Elementary to continuously generate [dbt exposures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/exposures) from Looker you will need to setup the following integrations:

1. Connect Looker - Elementary will continuously connect to Looker to extract metadata.
2. Connect dbt project [code repository](/cloud/integrations/code-repo/connect-code-repo) - Elementary will open a pull request to add exposures to your dbt project.

## Connect Looker

### Create permission set and role

To follow the [least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) security principle, before creating user for Elementary, create a permission set that allows to do only what is needed for Elementary to work.

- **Create a Permission Set**

  1.  In Looker, go to Admin > Roles. Click **"New Permission Set"**.
  2.  Name the Permission Set "Elementary permissions" and **check the boxes for the following permissions:**
      - `access_data`
      - `see_lookml_dashboards`
      - `see_looks`
        - `see_user_dashboards`
        - `see_sql`
        - `see_lookml`

- **Create a role**

  1.  **Click "New Role".**
  2.  Name the role "Elementary Role" as well.
  3.  **Select the "**Elementary permissions**" permission set**
  4.  **Create the role.**

### Create a dedicated Elementary Looker user

In Looker, go to Admin > Users.

1. Click **Add Users**. Provide any email you want.
2. Under Roles, **check "Elementary Role".**
3. Click **Done.**

### Create an API key for the user

1. Find the user you just created and click **Edit.**
2. You can give this user a name like **Elementary**.
3. Under **API Keys**, click **Edit Keys**.
4. Generate a new API key by clicking **New API Key**.
5. Copy down the **client ID** and **client secret**.
