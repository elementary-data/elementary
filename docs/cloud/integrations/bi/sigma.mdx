After you connect Sigma, Elementary will automatically and continuously extend the lineage to the workbook page & element level.
This will provide you end-to-end data lineage to understand your downstream dependencies, called exposures.

### Create API Client Credentials

Elementary needs authorized client credentials in your account in order to access Sigma's API on your behalf. <br/>
To create those, Please follow the [official Sigma documentation](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/generate-client-credentials#generate-api-client-credentials). 
Make sure you enable 'REST API' privileges for that client.

### Connecting Sigma to Elementary

Navigate to the **Account settings > Environments** and choose the environment to which you would like to connect Elementary.
Choose the Sigma connection and provide the following details to validate and complete the integration.

- **Cloud Provider:** To determine your Sigma cloud provider, Navigate to **Account -> General Settings** under Sigma's **Administration** menu and look for **'Cloud: ...'**. <br/> Should be one of the following:
  - `AWS US`
  - `AWS Canada`
  - `AWS Europe`
  - `AWS UK`
  - `Azure US`
  - `GCP`
- **Client ID**: The Sigma client ID you've created on the previous step.
- **Client Secret:** The new Sigma client secret you've created on the previous step.


### Limitations

`Datasets` or `Data Models` are currently excluded from computed lineage graph - which will point from DWH directly to your Workbook Elements. <br/>
