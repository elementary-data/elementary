After you connect Thoughtspot, Elementary will automatically and continuously extend the lineage to the liveboard and answer level.
This will provide you end-to-end data lineage to understand your downstream dependencies, called exposures.


### Enable Trusted Authentication on a privileged user

For Elementary to access your Thoughtspot instance's API on your behalf of your user, your user should have Trusted Authentication enabled. <br/>
To enable Trusted Authentication on a user, please follow the [official Thoughtspot documentation](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/trusted-auth-secret-key).<br/>
Make sure you copy the generated token (`Secret Key`) as you will need it to connect Thoughtspot to Elementary.

### User Privileges

For an easy integration, it's recommended for the connected user to be an administrator (`ADMINISTRATION` privilege), this will ensure Elementary can access all of your Liveboards and Answers.<br/>
It is also possible though to integrate with a regular user, just make sure it can download data (has `DATADOWNLOADING` privilege) for all the relvant ThoughtSpot entities you want Elementary to discover and show lineage for.

### Connecting Thoughtspot to Elementary

Navigate to the **Account settings > Environments** and choose the environment to which you would like to connect ThoughtSpot.
Choose the Thoughtspot connection and provide the following details to validate and complete the integration.

- **User Name:** The username of the user you want to use to connect to Thoughtspot.
- **Secret Key:** The token generated for the user you want to use to connect to Thoughtspot (from the previous step).
- **Base URL:** The URL of your Thoughtspot instance. This would be `'https://<cluster-name>.thoughtspot.cloud'` by default, or your custom domain if [you've configured one](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/10.1.0.cl/custom-domains#_domain_url_customization). If you're unsure, just check the URL you use to access your Thoughtspot instance in the browser.


### Limitations

`Worksheets` or `Models` are currently excluded from computed lineage graph - which will point from DWH directly to your Liveboards or Answers. <br/>
