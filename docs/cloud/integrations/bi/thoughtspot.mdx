After you connect Thoughtspot, Elementary will automatically and continuously extend the lineage to the liveboard and answer level.
This will provide you end-to-end data lineage to understand your downstream dependencies, called exposures.

### Create API Client Credentials

Elementary needs authorized client credentials in your account in order to access Thoughtspot's API on your behalf. <br/>
To create those, Please follow the [official Thoughtspot documentation](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/trusted-auth-secret-key).
Make sure you enable 'REST API' privileges for that client.
