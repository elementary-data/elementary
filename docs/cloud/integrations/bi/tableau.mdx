In order to allow Elementary to continuously generate [dbt exposures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/exposures) from Tableau you will need to setup the following integrations:

1. Connect Tableau - Elementary will continuously connect to Tableau to extract metadata.
2. Connect dbt project [code repository](/cloud/integrations/code-repo/connect-code-repo) - Elementary will open a pull request to add exposures to your dbt project.

## Connect Tableau

In order for Elementary to extract your metadata from Tableau you must meet all of the Tableau Metadata GraphQL requirements (most are set by default):

- Tableau Cloud/Server 2019.3 or later.
- Tableau REST API must not be disabled.
- The Metadata API must be enabled.
- The Metadata API must be accessed via an access token.

### Creating a Personal Access Token

Create a Personal Access Token in Tableau. For details on how to create a user token please refer to the **[Tableau guide](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/useracct.htm#create-a-personal-access-token)**.

When you generate this token, **Tableau will display a token secret only once**.
Make sure you store this token securely for future use, you will need it when you connect Tableau to Elementary.

### Connecting Tableau to Elementary

Navigate to the **Account settings > Environments** and choose the environment to which you would like to connect Tableau.
Choose the Tableau BI connection and provide the following details to validate and complete the integration.

- **Token Name:** The name of the token you created in Tableau.
- **Token Value**: The token secret you saved when generating the token in Tableau
- **Site information:** The site URL and name can be found on the URL you see when you visit the homepage of your Tableau instance. e.g. `https://prod-useast-a.online.tableau.com/#/site/elementary/projects`
  - **Site URL:**Â Copy and paste the base URL. e.g. `https://prod-useast-a.online.tableau.com/`
  - **Site Name**: Copy and paste the site name. e.g. `elementary`
