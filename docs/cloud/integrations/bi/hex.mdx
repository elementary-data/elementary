After you connect Hex, Elementary will automatically and continuously extend the lineage to the project & cell level.
This will provide you end-to-end data lineage to understand your downstream dependencies, called exposures.

### Create API Token

Elementary needs an API token in your account in order to access Hex's API on your behalf. <br/>
To create one, Please follow the [official Hex documentation](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/administration/account-settings/api-tokens#creating-an-api-token). 
Make sure you enable 'Read' privileges for that token.

### Connecting Hex to Elementary

Navigate to the **Account settings > Environments** and choose the environment to which you would like to connect Elementary.
Choose the Hex connection and provide the following details to validate and complete the integration.

- **Base URL**: Your Hex workspace URL. For example: `https://app.hex.tech/my-workspace/`
- **Workspace Token**: The Hex workspace token you've created on the previous step.


### Limitations

- **Hex assets will only be visible if their project has run within the last 14 days.** Elementary tracks Hex query history to determine asset visibility, and only projects with recent execution activity will appear in the lineage graph.
