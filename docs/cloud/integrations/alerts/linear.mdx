## Creating Linear ticket from incidents
When an incident is created, you can create a Linear ticket from the incident page by simply clicking on "Create Linear Ticket".
The ticket will automatically be created in Linear, in the team you chose upon connecting Linear.

After the ticket is created you can see the Linear ticket link in the incident page.
The ticket will also contain a link to the incident in Elementary.

<Note>Note: Elementary will not update the ticket in Linear when the incident is resolved or changed in any way</Note>
