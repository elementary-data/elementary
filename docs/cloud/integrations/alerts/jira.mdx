## Creating Jira issues from incidents
When an incident is created, you can create a Jira issue from the incident page by simply clicking on "Create Jira Ticket".
The ticket will automatically be created in Jira, in the team you chose upon connecting Jira.

After the ticket is created you can see the Jira issue link in the incident page.
The ticket will also contain a link to the incident in Elementary.

<Note>Note: Elementary will not update the ticket in Jira when the incident is resolved or changed in any way</Note>
