Elementary supports sending alerts directly to email recipients, without requiring environment-level configuration. Email destinations can be added and managed directly within alert rules.

## Overview

- Email **does not** need to be configured as an integration on the Environment page.
- Email can be added **directly as a provider** when creating or editing alert rules.
- Users can enter individual emails or paste entire lists.

## Creating an Email Alert Destination

1. Go to **Alert Destinations**.
2. Select **Add new alert provider**.
3. Choose **Email**.

### Adding recipients

- Users may type or paste one or more email addresses.
- The system validates email format for each entry.
- When pasting combined fields (e.g., "Name email@company.com"), only the email address is stored.
- Previously used emails may be surfaced for autocomplete (optional enhancement).

## Visibility Across the UI

### Alert Rules

- Email recipients appear under the destination.
- If the list is long, the UI shows the first few emails and then a "+X more" indicator.
- Hovering displays the full recipient list.

### Test Overview

- Connected email destinations appear in the Destinations section for each test.

### Alert Destinations Tab

- All defined email alert destinations can be viewed and managed in this tab.
