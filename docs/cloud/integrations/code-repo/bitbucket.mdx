Elementary connects to the code repository where your dbt project code is managed, and opens PRs with configuration changes.

## Recommended: Connect using Elementary Bitbucket App

Navigate to the **Account settings > Environments** and choose the environment to which you would like to connect the dbt project code repository.

Simply Click the blue button that says "Connect with Elementary Bitbucket App" and follow the instructions.
In the menu that opens up later on, select the repository where your dbt project is stored, and if needed the branch and path to the dbt project.

<Warning>Requires a user with permissions to install new applications in the repository</Warning>

### Alternative: Create a Gitlab project token

If connecting the Elementary Bitbucket App isn't an option, you can connect using a token managed by your team instead.
