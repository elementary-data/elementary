title: "Atlan"

Elementary aims to meet business users where they live, so we believe it's important to allow anyone who uses data to
 know whether the data is healthy quickly, easily and without any technical knowledge required. This is why we integrated with Atlan.

The integration works by pushing key insights to Atlan assets as custom metadata.
This metadata includes data health scores and open incidents, providing visibility into the quality and status of your
data.
