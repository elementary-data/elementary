title: "dbt core"

Elementary integrates with dbt core (1.3.0 and above) for the supported data warehouses.

Users need to [deploy the dbt package](/cloud/onboarding/quickstart-dbt-package) in the monitored project, and it will collect results and artifacts in run time using on-run-end hooks. 
Results are saved to a dedicated schema, and Elementary syncs the results through the DWH connection.

## Syncs schedule

For near-real-time results, it is recommended to change the sync configuration from the default hourly syncs to [webhook triggered syncs](/cloud/guides/sync-scheduling).
