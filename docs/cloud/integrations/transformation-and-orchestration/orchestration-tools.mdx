## Jobs information

Elementary can collect jobs data from your orchestration tool, including `job run url`, `job name`, `job id`.
These are presented in the lineage node info tab.
To collect jobs info for your orchestrator, check out [this guide](/cloud/guides/collect-job-data).

## Syncs schedule

For near-real-time results, it is recommended to change the sync configuration from the default hourly syncs to [webhook triggered syncs](/cloud/guides/sync-scheduling) and invoke using your orchestration tool.
