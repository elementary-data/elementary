Elementary's Datadog integration enables streaming audit logs and system logs directly to your Datadog account for centralized log management and monitoring.

## Overview

When enabled, Elementary automatically streams your workspace's [audit logs](/cloud/features/collaboration-and-communication/audit_logs/overview) ([user activity logs](/cloud/features/collaboration-and-communication/audit_logs/user-activity-logs) and [system logs](/cloud/features/collaboration-and-communication/audit_logs/system-logs)) to Datadog using the [Datadog Logs API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/logs/#send-logs). This allows you to:

- Centralize all logs in your Datadog dashboard
- Set up custom alerts and monitors on log events
- Correlate Elementary logs with other application logs
- Perform advanced log analysis and search
- Maintain long-term log retention in Datadog

## Prerequisites

Before configuring log streaming to Datadog, you'll need:

1. **Datadog API Key** - Your Datadog API key for authentication
   - You can find or create an API key in your Datadog account under [Organization Settings > API Keys](https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/api-keys)

2. **Datadog Site** (optional) - Your Datadog site region
   - Default: `datadoghq.com` (US)
   - EU: `datadoghq.eu`
   - US3: `us3.datadoghq.com`
   - US5: `us5.datadoghq.com`
   - AP1: `ap1.datadoghq.com`

## Configuring Log Streaming to Datadog

1. Navigate to the [**Logs**](/cloud/features/collaboration-and-communication/audit_logs/overview) page:
   - Click on your **account name** in the top-right corner of the UI
   - Open the dropdown menu
   - Select **Logs**

2. Click on **Configure Log Streaming** or the **Settings** icon in the logs interface

3. Select **Datadog** as your log streaming destination

4. Enter your Datadog configuration:
   - **API Key**: Your Datadog API key
   - **Site** (optional): Your Datadog site region (defaults to `datadoghq.com` if not specified)
   - **Service Name** (optional): Custom service name for logs in Datadog (defaults to `elementary`)
   - **Source** (optional): Custom source tag for logs (defaults to `elementary-cloud`)

5. Choose which log types to stream:
   - **[User Activity Logs](/cloud/features/collaboration-and-communication/audit_logs/user-activity-logs)**: Stream all user activity and audit events
   - **[System Logs](/cloud/features/collaboration-and-communication/audit_logs/system-logs)**: Stream system-level events (syncs, alert deliveries, etc.)
   - You can enable one or both log types

6. Click **Save** to enable log streaming

<Note>
The log streaming configuration applies to your entire workspace. All logs matching your selected log types will be streamed to Datadog in real-time.

## Log Format in Datadog

Logs are sent to Datadog with the following structure:

### User Activity Logs

Each user activity log entry includes:

- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp of the event
- `status`: Log level (`info` for successful actions, `error` for failed actions)
- `message`: Human-readable description of the action
- `service`: Service name (configurable, defaults to `elementary`)
- `source`: Source tag (configurable, defaults to `elementary-cloud`)
- `dd.tags`: Additional tags including:
  - `log_type:audit`
  - `action:<action_name>` (e.g., `user_login`, `create_test`)
  - `success:<true|false>`
  - `user_email:<user_email>`
  - `env_id:<environment_id>` (if applicable)
  - `env_name:<environment_name>` (if applicable)
- Custom attributes from the event content (JSON parsed)

### System Logs

Each system log entry includes:

- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp of the event
- `status`: Log level (`info` for successful operations, `error` for failed operations)
- `message`: Human-readable description of the system event
- `service`: Service name (configurable, defaults to `elementary`)
- `source`: Source tag (configurable, defaults to `elementary-cloud`)
- `dd.tags`: Additional tags including:
  - `log_type:system`
  - `action:<action_name>` (e.g., `dbt_data_sync_completed`, `alerts_sent`)
  - `success:<true|false>`
  - `env_id:<environment_id>` (if applicable)
  - `env_name:<environment_name>` (if applicable)
- Custom attributes from the event content (JSON parsed)

## Viewing Logs in Datadog

Once configured, logs will appear in your Datadog [Log Explorer](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs) within a few seconds of being generated.

You can filter logs using:
- `source:elementary-cloud` - All Elementary logs
- `log_type:audit` - User activity logs only
- `log_type:system` - System logs only
- `action:<action_name>` - Specific action types
- `env_name:<environment_name>` - Logs from a specific environment
- `success:false` - Failed operations only

## Troubleshooting

### Logs not appearing in Datadog

1. **Verify API Key**: Ensure your Datadog API key is valid and has the necessary permissions
2. **Check Site Configuration**: Verify you've selected the correct Datadog site region
3. **Review Log Types**: Confirm the log types you want to stream are enabled
4. **Check Datadog Status**: Verify your Datadog account is active and not rate-limited

### Rate Limiting

Datadog has rate limits for log ingestion. If you're experiencing issues:
- Check your Datadog account's rate limits in the [Usage & Billing](https://app.datadoghq.com/billing/usage) page
- Consider filtering which log types you stream if you have high log volume
- Contact Datadog support if you need to increase your rate limits

## Disabling Log Streaming

To disable log streaming to Datadog:

1. Navigate to the [**Logs**](/cloud/features/collaboration-and-communication/audit_logs/overview) page
2. Click on **Configure Log Streaming** or the **Settings** icon
3. Click **Disable** or remove the Datadog configuration
4. Confirm the action

<Warning>
Disabling log streaming will stop sending new logs to Datadog immediately. Historical logs already sent to Datadog will remain in your Datadog account according to your retention settings.
</Warning>
