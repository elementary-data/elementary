    <Note>
    Make sure to verify that login works in an incognito window or with another user before logging out.
    If it does not, disable the SSO configuration immediately and contact the Elementary team.
    </Note>
</Accordion>

## Provisioning

Elementary supports user provisioning via SCIM to automate user management. If you want to enable automatic provisioning, follow these steps:
- In the **Microsoft Entra portal**, go to **Enterprise Applications** and select the newly created SAML application.
- Navigate to **Provisioning** and click **Get Started**.
- Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.
- Configure the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** (email the Elementary team for a 1password vault with the configuration).
- Click **Test Connection** to validate the setup.
- Enable provisioning and save changes.

This setup ensures that users are automatically created, updated, and deactivated in Elementary based on their status in Microsoft Entra ID. You can always reach out if you need any help.
