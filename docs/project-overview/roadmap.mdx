title: "Roadmap"

Our plan is to eventually build a data observability platform that is open, transparent and powered by the community. A solution that data teams could easily integrate into their workflows, detect data incidents and prevent them from even happening in the first place.

# Public roadmap

Our goal is to build what our users need, and the best way to do it is to share our ideas and listen to your inputs, so here is our [public roadmap](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary/projects/1)

**Please use 👍 to vote for issues in the roadmap**, it will help us prioritize!
**We will be extremely happy if you would open additional issues and requests** as well. (Don't worry about the format!)
