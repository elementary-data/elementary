### 5. Run tests

```shell Terminal
dbt test
```

You can also run only some tests.
Only tests you run after the installation will show up in the UI.

After you ran your tests, we recommend that you ensure that the results were loaded to `elementary_test_results` table.

<Snippet file="faq/question-change-elementary-schema.mdx" />
<Accordion title="Important: Materialization config">

For elementary to work, it needs to create some of the models as incremental tables.
Make sure that there are no global materialization configurations that affect elementary, such as:

```yml dbt_project.yml
materialized: "{{ 'table' if target.name == 'prod-cloud' else 'view' }}"
```

Make sure to place the 'elementary' configuration under the models key, and other configs under your project name.

Example:

```yml dbt_project.yml
models:
  my_project:
    materialized: "{{ 'table' if target.name == 'prod-cloud' else 'view' }}"

  elementary:
    +schema: "elementary"
```

**If you change materialization settings, make sure to run `dbt run -s elementary --full-refresh`.**

</Accordion>

### What happens now?

Once the elementary dbt package has been installed and configured, your test results, run results and [dbt artifacts](/dbt/dbt-artifacts) will be loaded to elementary schema tables.

If you see data in these models you completed the package deployment (Congrats! 🎉).
