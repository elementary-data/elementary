To start using Elementary to monitor you dbt tests, executions and data, you need to add our dbt package to your dbt project.

<Accordion title="What are dbt packages and packages.yml?">
A dbt package is additional Jinja and SQL code that is added to your project, for additional functionality. In fact, each package is a dbt project. By adding a package to your project, you are adding the package code to be part of your project, you can reference it's macros, execute it's models, and so on.

Add packages to your project by creating a 'packages.yml' file under the main project directory (where your 'dbt_project.yml is), and adding the relevant package. After you add a new package, run dbt deps to actually pull it's code to your project. This is also how you update packages.
Some packages we recommend you check out: [dbt_utils](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/tree/0.8.2/), [dbt_date](https://github.com/calogica/dbt-date/tree/0.5.4/), [codegen](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/tree/0.5.0/).

## Install the dbt package

### 1. Add elementary to `packages.yml`

Add the following to your `packages.yml` file (if missing, create it where `dbt_project.yml` is):

```yml packages.yml
packages:
  - package: elementary-data/elementary
    version: 0.4.8
    ## compatible with Elementary CLI version 0.4.8
    ## see docs: https://docs.elementary-data.com/
```

### 2. Add to your `dbt_project.yml`

<TipInfo>
  This means Elementary will use `your_schema_elementary` as its schema.
</TipInfo>

```yml dbt_project.yml
models:
  ## elementary models will be created in the schema '<your_schema>_elementary'
  ## see docs: https://docs.elementary-data.com/
  elementary:
    +schema: "elementary"
```

<Accordion title="Important: Materialization config">

For elementary to work, it needs to create some of the models as incremental tables. Make sure that there are no global materialization configurations that affect elementary, such as:

```yml dbt_project.yml
materialized: "{{ 'table' if target.name == 'prod-cloud' else 'view' }}"
```

Make sure to place the 'elementary' configuration under the models key, and other configs under your project name.

Example:

```yml dbt_project.yml
models:
my_project:
materialized: "{{ 'table' if target.name == 'prod-cloud' else 'view' }}"

elementary:
+schema: "elementary"
```

</Accordion>

### 3. Import the package

```shell Terminal
dbt deps
```

### 4. Run to create the package models

```shell Terminal
dbt run --select elementary
```

This will mostly create empty tables, that will be updated with artifacts, metrics and test results in your future dbt executions.

### What happens now?

Once the elementary dbt package has been installed and configured, your test results, run results and [dbt artifacts](./dbt/dbt-artifacts) will be loaded to elementary schema tables.

If you see data in these models you completed the package deployment (Congrats! 🎉).

## What's next?

1. [Install the Elementary CLI](./quickstart-cli) to:
   - [Visualize all dbt test results and runs in a report](./quickstart/generate-report-ui) ✨
   - [Send informative Slack alerts](../quickstart/send-slack-alerts) 📣
2. [Add data anomaly detection dbt tests](../guides/add-elementary-tests) 📈
