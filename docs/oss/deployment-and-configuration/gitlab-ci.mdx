title: "GitLab CI"
---

You can use GitLab's CI in order to run `edr` commands in an automated manner.

For example, you can use it to send a data observability report on changes in your dbt project, monitor for data issues
periodically and send alerts to your Slack, and much more.

## Setup

### Profile

`edr` requires a dbt connection profile called `elementary` that points to your Elementary schema in the warehouse.
More information on that can be found [here](/oss/quickstart/quickstart-cli).
Accordingly, we'll need to provide the pipeline with that profile.

If you already have a `profiles.yml` in your repository, simply add the `elementary` profile to it, and make sure the credentials are [loaded as variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui).
`edr` will automatically pick up on the `profiles.yml` file.

Alternatively, you can write your `profiles.yml` as a whole to a [GitLab variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui).

### Pipeline

In order to setup the Elementary pipeline in your GitLab repository, you'll need to create a file at the root of the project called `.gitlab-ci.yml` with the following content.

```yml
image:
  name: ghcr.io/elementary-data/elementary:<TAG> # Replace <TAG> with edr's version.
  entrypoint: [""]

elementary:
  script:
    - echo "$PROFILES_YML" > profiles.yml # Only required if `profiles.yml` doesn't exist in repository and using `PROFILES_YML` secret.
    - edr monitor --slack-webhook "$SLACK_WEBHOOK"
    - edr send-report --aws-access-key-id "$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" --aws-secret-access-key "$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" --s3-bucket-name "$S3_BUCKET_NAME"
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - edr.log
```

The `image` property defines the Docker image to be used within the pipeline.
In this case, we'll be using [Elementary's official Docker image](/oss/deployment-and-configuration/docker).

The `elementary` property defines the job and the `edr` commands that will be ran.
It also uploads the `edr.log` as a [job artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.html) which can be useful for debugging purposes.

Feel free to edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` to your liking and make sure to add the required variables when doing so.
