Elementary has a _GitHub Actions_ integration that allows you to run `edr` commands in an automated manner.

For example, you can use it to send a data observability report on changes in your dbt project, monitor for data issues
periodically and send alerts to your Slack, and much more.

More information can be found in [Elementary's GitHub Action](https://github.com/elementary-data/run-elementary-action).
