Elementary Teams integration includes sending [Teams alerts](/oss/guides/alerts/send-teams-alerts) on failures in dbt tests and models.

## Integration options

There is one integration option for Microsoft Teams: a Webhook. This method let you receive alerts from Elementary, but lacks
some support that is available in the Slack integration solution.
Below is features support comparison table (with Slack), to help you select the integration method.

| Integration   | Elementary alerts | Elementary report | Multiple channels | Slack workflows |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Teams Webhook | ✅                | ❌                | ❌                | ❌              |
