Elementary Teams integration includes sending [Teams alerts](/oss/guides/alerts/send-teams-alerts) on failures in dbt tests and models. The alerts are sent using Microsoft Teams Adaptive Cards format, which provides rich formatting and interactive capabilities.

## Integration options

There are two ways to create a webhook for Microsoft Teams:

1. **Microsoft Teams Connectors (Legacy)**: The traditional way of creating webhooks, but this method is being deprecated by Microsoft.
2. **Power Automate Workflows (Recommended)**: The newer, more flexible way to create webhooks. Note that when using this method, Elementary CLI cannot directly verify if messages were delivered - you'll need to monitor your workflow runs in Power Automate.

Below is a features support comparison table (with Slack), to help you select the integration method.

| Integration              | Elementary alerts | Elementary report | Multiple channels |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Teams Connector (Legacy) | ✅                | ❌                | ❌                |
| Power Automate Workflows | ✅                | ❌                | ❌                |

**Note:** Microsoft 365 Connectors (previously called Office 365 Connectors) are nearing deprecation. We recommend using Power Automate Workflows for new integrations.
