Elementary Teams integration includes sending [Teams alerts](/oss/guides/alerts/send-teams-alerts) on failures in dbt tests and models. The alerts are sent using Microsoft Teams Adaptive Cards format, which provides rich formatting and interactive capabilities.

MS Teams supports Elementary Alerts, but unlike Slack, it does not support the Elementary report or multiple channels.

## Integration options

There are two ways to create a webhook for Microsoft Teams:

1. **Microsoft Teams Connectors (Legacy)**: The traditional way of creating webhooks, but this method is being deprecated by Microsoft.
2. **Power Automate Workflows (Recommended)**: The newer, more flexible way to create webhooks. Note that when using this method, Elementary CLI cannot directly verify if messages were delivered - you'll need to monitor your workflow runs in Power Automate.



<Warning>Microsoft 365 Connectors (previously called Office 365 Connectors) are nearing deprecation. We recommend using Power Automate Workflows for new integrations.</Warning>
