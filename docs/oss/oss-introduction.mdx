**Elementary OSS is a CLI tool that works alongside the [Elementary dbt package](https://www.notion.so/guides/modules-overview/dbt-package).** With the dbt package, you gain powerful anomaly detection tests and metadata tables to monitor data quality trends over time.

By deploying the CLI, you can **send alerts and self-host the Elementary data observability report**, a comprehensive view of your dbt runs and all dbt test results, helping you track data lineage, test coverage, and overall pipeline health. 

For a scalable and collaborative data quality platform, **look into the [Elementary Cloud Platform](https://www.notion.so/cloud/introduction)** - A fully managed, enterprise-ready solution with ML-powered anomaly detection, flexible data discovery, integrated incident management, and collaboration toolsâ€”all with minimal setup and infrastructure maintenance. See here a [detailed features comparison](https://www.notion.so/overview/cloud-vs-oss).
