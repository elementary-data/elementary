Elementary OSS is a CLI tool you can deploy on top of the Elementary dbt package and orchestrate to send Slack alerts and self-host the Elementary report.

To gain the most value from the Elementary dbt package, we recommend using it with the Elementary Cloud Platform.  

The difference between the CLI and the Elementary Cloud Platform

- **The Elementary Cloud Platform  - for** **organizational data quality initiatives** (e.g., platform refactoring, governance projects, or AI/ML adoption).
The Elementary Cloud Platform offers pipeline monitoring, incident management, lineage tracking, dashboards, health scores, and alerts. It empowers data engineers, analytics engineers, and data analysts to collaborate, resolve issues efficiently, and deliver trusted data products. Learn more about the [Elementary Cloud Platform](https://docs.elementary-data.com/cloud/introduction) or [book a demo](https://cal.com/maayansa/elementary-intro-docs).
- **The CLI tool - for individual use**
The CLI tool is used to detect issues, send Slack alerts, and self-host the Elementary report. It is the right choice if youâ€™ll be the primary user of Elementary. Learn more about the CLI tool below.
