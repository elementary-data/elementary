title: "CLI commands and usage"
---

With any of the CLI commands, you can use the `--help` flag and get instructions and available options:

```shell
edr --help
```

## CLI commands

Read from the test results table and send new [alerts to Slack](/oss/guides/alerts-configuration):

```shell
edr monitor
```

Read from the test results table and generate the [Elementary UI](/features/data-observability-dashboard):

```shell
edr report
```

Read from the test results table and generate the [Elementary UI](/features/data-observability-dashboard) and send
it to external
platforms such as Slack, S3, GCS:

```shell
edr send-report
```

## CLI Options

You can define options either via the CLI or using environment variables in the following
format: `EDR_<COMMAND>_<OPTION>=<VALUE>`.

```shell
export EDR_REPORT_FILE_PATH="my_report.html"
edr report
# Equivalent to: edr report --file-path "my_report.html"
```

Here is a list of all the available options:

- **dbt project path:**
  The path of the directory in which your `dbt_project.yml` file is located. Default is the working directory.

```shell
--project-dir <PATH>
```

- **Profile directory path:**
  The path of the directory in which your `profiles.yml` file is located. Default is `HOME_DIR/.dbt`.
- This option must be configured together with profile name.

```shell
-p, --profiles-dir <PATH>
```

- **Configuration directory path:**
  The path of the directory in which your `config.yml` file is located. Default is `HOME_DIR/.edr`.

```shell
-c, --config-dir <PATH>
```

- **Target directory path**
  The path where all output files such as logs and reports will be saved. If not configured, the default is ./edr_target.

```shell
--target-path <PATH>
```

- **Profile target:**
  Choose a specific target in case you have multiple targets for Elementary.

```shell
-t, --profile-target <target_name>
```

- **Profile target of your dbt project:**
  Choose a specific target in case you have multiple targets for your dbt project.

```shell
--project-profile-target <target_name>
```

- **Select:**
  Filter the alerts / report using a selector.
  - See all of the alerts supported selector methods [here](/oss/guides/alerts-configuration#alerts-cli-flags).
  - See all of the report supported selector methods [here](/oss/guides/generate-report-ui#generating-a-report-for-single-invocation).

```shell
--select <selector_method>:<value>
```

- **Slack webhook URL:**
  Pass the webhook URL of your Slack channel to edr as a parameter.

```shell
-s, --slack-webhook <slack_webhook_url>
```

- **Slack token and Slack channel name:**
  Pass the Slack token and the Slack channel to edr as parameters.

```shell
-st, --slack-token <slack_token>
-ch, --slack-channel-name <slack_channel_name_to_send_the_file_to>
```

- **Full refresh dbt package models:**
  Force running a full refresh of all incremental models in the edr dbt package.

```shell
 -f, --full-refresh-dbt-package BOOLEAN
```

- **Days back:**
  Set a limit to how far back Elementary should collect dbt and Elementary results while generating alerts/report.

```shell
-d, --days-back INTEGER
```

- **Report file path:**
  The local file path where Elementary's report will be saved.

```shell
--file-path TEXT
```

- **Report remote file name:**
  The report's file name, this is how it will be called on Slack, S3, GCS when using `send-report`.

```shell
--file-name TEXT
```

- **S3 endpoint url:**
  The endpoint of the S3 bucket when using `send-report` with any S3 compatible cloud storage service.

```shell
--s3-endpoint-url TEXT
```

- **Timezone:**
  The timezone that will be used upon calculating the alerts' time field.  
  A list of timezones can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) under _TZ
  database name_.

```shell
-tz, --timezone TEXT
```

- **dbt Quoting:**
  Optionally control the [quoting setting](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/quoting) of the
  internal dbt package of the elementary CLI.
  You should use this setting if you are overriding dbt's default quoting in your main dbt package.

```shell
-q, --dbt-quoting [all|none|combination of any of: database,schema,identifier]

# Examples:
# * --dbt-quoting all
# * --dbt-quoting none
# * --dbt-quoting identifier
# * --dbt-quoting schema,identifier
```

- **Disable samples:**
  Disable sampling of data in the report and alerts.
  Useful if your data is sensitive or contains PII.

```shell
--disable-samples BOOLEAN
```

- **Project name:**
  You can optionally pass a custom project name that will be shown in the report.
  The default value is the name of your dbt project.

```shell
--project-name TEXT
```

- **Environment:**
  This flag indicates if you are running Elementary in a production or development environment and will be reflected
  accordingly in the report.

```shell
--env [dev|prod]
```

- **Suppression interval:**
  Suppress similar alerts for a given number of hours.
  [Read more about this setting here.](/oss/guides/alerts-configuration#suppression-interval-flag)
  The default suppression interval is 0.

```shell
edr monitor --suppression-interval [int]
```

- **Override configuration from dbt project:**
  Sometimes, for example during testing and development, you want all your alerts sent to a single slack channel,
  without suppression, regardless of how they are configured in the model config block or schema.yml in your dbt project.
  You can do this by using this flag.
  Please note that when using this flag without passing a suppression interval parameter, the suppression interval for all the alerts will be overridden by the default value, 0.

```shell
edr monitor --override-dbt-project-config --slack-token <your_slack_token> --slack-channel-name <slack_channel_to_post_at> --suppression-interval 0
```
