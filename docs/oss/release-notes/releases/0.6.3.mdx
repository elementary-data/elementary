### 🔥 What's new?

- **Slack alerts V2** 2️⃣

  - **Elementary now supports customizing alerts, so you could notify data producers and consumers** 🧑‍🔧
    - Instead of sending detailed technical alerts, you can select fields. Learn more here [how to configure it](/oss/guides/alerts/elementary-alerts#customize-alerts-owners-test-descriptions-tags-subscribers-and-layout).
  - Email owners will be translated to Slack handles in the alerts. Thanks [Josh Elston-Green](https://github.com/jelstongreen) for contributing.
  - Alerts also underwent **layout improvements** 🎨

- **New data tests** 🩺

  - [Advanced schema tests](/data-tests/schema-tests/schema-changes), **useful for source monitoring and enforcing data contracts:** ✅
    - `schema_changes_from_baseline` - Define a schema in your `models/<properties.yml>` and ensure its validity.
    - `json_schema` - Validate the schema of JSON columns. 😱
    - To ease configuration and implementation - both tests include operations to **auto-generate the schema.**
  - New and [improved table anomalies tests](/data-tests/add-elementary-tests), including `where_expression`: 📉
    - `volume_anomalies` - Monitor your row count over time.
    - `freshness_anomalies` - Monitor the freshness of you data over time.

- **Report UI new features** 🆕

  - Filter your report by **Tags & Owners sidebars** #️⃣🤵🏻
  - [dbt-expectations](https://github.com/calogica/dbt-expectations) integration in the UI, including test descriptions.
  - Custom test descriptions were added to the UI.

- **Monitor job results** ⚛️

  - Added job-related columns to `dbt_invocations` and created `job_run_results` table.
  - Keep track of your dbt jobs in dbt Cloud, GitHub Actions, Airflow, etc.
  - The new columns [can be viewed here](https://github.com/elementary-data/dbt-data-reliability/blob/4695474ba10740a95822954c44adbc52f4f2af95/models/run_results.yml#L81).

- **Sensitive data / PII** 🤫
  - Have sensitive data that contains PII? x
  - Use the new flag (`-disable-samples`) to disable sampling of data in the report and alerts
