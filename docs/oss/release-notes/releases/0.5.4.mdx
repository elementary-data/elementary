_November 3, 2022: [v0.5.4 Python](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary/releases/tag/v0.5.4), [v0.5.4 dbt package](https://github.com/elementary-data/dbt-data-reliability/releases/tag/0.5.4)_

### 🔥 What's new?

- **Source freshness alerts** 🥬🔔

  - Elementary now provides alerts for all dbt operations, including source freshness!
  - Here are [the docs](/oss/guides/alerts/elementary-alerts#alert-on-source-freshness-failures).

- **Artifacts are uploaded at on-run-end hooks** ⚡️

  - **You no longer need to run** `dbt run --select elementary` **on merge!**
  - This will keep metadata up-to-date and avoid inconsistency with alerts and report.
  - We also made changes to the upload method to improve performance.

- **New `dbt_invocations` table** 🆕⏱

  - Tracks run times, command, vars, selected_resources, dbt and Elementary versions

- **Improved report performance** 📊

  - Based on your feedback, we invested a lot in performance improvements in the report to make it slick for big envs.
  - We are still improving the lineage screen, but this is already an improvement.

- **Improved lineage screen filters** 🔽
