_May 17, 2023: [v0.7.10 Python](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary/releases/tag/v0.7.10), [v0.7.8 dbt package](https://github.com/elementary-data/dbt-data-reliability/releases/tag/0.7.8)_

### 🔥 What's new?

- **New artifacts model - dbt_columns 🆕**
  - Many users requested that we add this model with useful information about the columns in your project.
  - We also plan to add features to the report and alerts based on this data. Stay tuned... :coming-soon:
  - (This is not yet supported for Databricks, [working on it](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary/issues/872))
- **New lineage filters - Tags and owners #️⃣👥**
  - You can now filter the lineage to see only the nodes that are relevant to a business department or a specific owner, and their upstream and downstream nodes.
  - We also made some general improvements to the filters usability like adding search and clear all.
- **Test results sample size in the report can be changed 🔢**

  - The report is no longer limited to 5 results, you can change this by adding the var:
    - `test_sample_row_count: 10`

- New flag - `edr --version` 🏁
  - Thank you [@Manul Patel](https://elementary-community.slack.com/team/U054N92MU11) for contributing this  🤩
