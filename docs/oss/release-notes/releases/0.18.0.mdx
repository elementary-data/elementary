## What's Changed

- Invocation Filter Fix: Invocation filters now apply to both reports and their summaries, ensuring consistent filtering.​
- Python Version Support: Official support for Python 3.8 has been discontinued to align with dbt's supported versions.​
- Test Description Bug: Fixed an issue where test descriptions were missing in alerts when using dbt version 1.9.

Note: We've bumped the minor version to align with the recent minor version update in the dbt package.
