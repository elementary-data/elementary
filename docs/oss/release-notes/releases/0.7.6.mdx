_March 27, 2023: [v0.7.6 Python](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary/releases/tag/v0.7.6), [v0.7.4 dbt package](https://github.com/elementary-data/dbt-data-reliability/releases/tag/0.7.4)_

### 🔥 What's new?

- **Custom test names are now supported!** 🖌🎨
  - For every dbt test, you can provide an indicative name and Elementary will show it!
  - Here is an example:

```yaml properties.yml
tests:
  - accepted_values:
      values: ["ios", "android", "windows"]
      name: unexpected_operating_system
```

- You can read more about the use cases from [@Marta Massarotti](https://elementary-community.slack.com/team/U04JHEZRDUM) and [@Owen](https://elementary-community.slack.com/team/U04P81RELTS) in the [Github issue](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary/issues/299).

- **CLI improvements** 💻😎
  - Target path for all `edr` files
    - We added a new `-target-path` flag for all the outputs to make it easier to maintain and deploy Elementary.
    - Thanks [@Gemma Down](https://elementary-community.slack.com/team/U04LT9TNUE4) for the issue and use case!
  - Added `edr monitor debug` command
    - This would help you debug connection and profile issues.
