On new releases, you will need to upgrade the Elementary CLI and the dbt package.

## Upgrade Elementary dbt package

1. On your `packages.yml` file, change the version to the latest:

```yml packages.yml
packages:
  - package: elementary-data/elementary
    version: < latest version >
```

2. Run the command:

```shell
dbt deps
```

3. When there's a change in the structure of the Elementary tables, the minor version is raised. If you're updating a minor version (for example 0.17.X -> 0.18.X), run this command to rebuild the Elementary tables:

```shell
dbt run --select elementary
```

## Upgrade Elementary CLI

Just run:

```shell
pip install elementary-data --upgrade
```
