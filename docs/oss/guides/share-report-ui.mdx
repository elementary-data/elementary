You can share the report with others by using the command:

```shell
edr send-report
```

The command will generate and upload the report to the supported external platforms:

- [Amazon S3](/oss/guides/share-observability-report/host-on-s3)
- [Google GCS](/oss/guides/share-observability-report/host-on-gcs)
- [Azure Blob Storage](/oss/guides/share-observability-report/host-on-azure)
- [Share via Slack](/oss/guides/share-observability-report/share-via-slack) (as an attachment)

In addition to distributing the report itself, you can send a [report summary notification to Slack](/oss/guides/share-observability-report/send-report-summary) (relevant to all supported platforms).
This is useful for you and your team members to understand quickly if there is something in the new report you should address.

<Info>
  - It is possible to specify more than one platform, and the report will be
  sent to all. - All arguments can be passed either as CLI arguments or in the
  `config.yml` file.

After you decide how to distribute the report and set up the relevant platform, read about how to [deploy Elementary in production](/oss/deployment-and-configuration/elementary-in-production).
