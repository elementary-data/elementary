## Alerts CLI flags

<Warning>
  Alert vars are deprecated! We recommend filtering the alerts
  using CLI selectors instead.
</Warning>



#### Filter alerts

Elementary supports filtering the alerts by tag, owner, model, status or resource type.

Using filters, you can send alerts to the relevant people and teams by running `edr` multiple times with different filters on each run.

<Info>
Alerts on skipped tests and models are filtered out by default. if you want to receive those alerts, apply the statuses filter and include them explicitly.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>

```shell tags filter
edr monitor --filters tags:critical
edr monitor --filters tags:finance,marketing
```

```shell owners filter
edr monitor --filters owners:@jeff
edr monitor --filters owners:@jessy,@jeff
```

```shell models filter
edr monitor --filters models:customers
edr monitor --filters models:orders,customers,signups
```

```shell statuses filter
edr monitor --filters statuses:warn,fail
edr monitor --filters statuses:error
edr monitor --filters statuses:skipped
```

```shell resource_types filter
edr monitor --filters resource_types:model
edr monitor --filters resource_types:test
edr monitor --filters resource_types:test,source_freshness
```

</CodeGroup>

The `--filters` flag can be used multiple times to apply multiple filters. The filters are combined using the logical AND operator.
The comma `,` is used to separate multiple values for the same filter, creating a logical OR.

<CodeGroup>

```shell multiple filters
edr monitor --filters resource_types:model --filters tags:finance,marketing
```

</CodeGroup>



#### Group alerts by table

By default, Elementary sends a single alert to notify on each failure with extensive information for fast triage.

Elementary also supports grouping alerts by table.
In this case, a single Slack notification will be generated containing all issues associated with this table.
The created notification will contain a union of the relevant owners, tags and subscribers.

Due to their nature, grouped alerts will contain less information on each issue.

```shell
edr monitor --group-by table
```

#### Suppression interval flag

Don’t want to get multiple alerts if the same test keeps failing?
You can now configure an alert_suppression_interval, this is a “snooze” period for alerts on the same issue.
Elementary won’t send new alerts on the same issue that are generated within suppression interval.

The flag configuration is the suppression interval duration in hours, and the default is 0 hours (no alert suppression).
If configured otherwise in the dbt project config block or meta, the CLI value will be ignored (unless `--override-dbt-project-config` is used).

```shell
edr monitor --suppression-interval 24
```

#### Alert group threshold

Set a minimum alert threshold before grouping notifications into a summary alert — keeping noise low while ensuring nothing gets missed.

```shell
edr monitor --group-alerts-threshold 5
```
