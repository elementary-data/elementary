**Prerequisites**

- [GCS bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets).

### Authentication

To host the report on GCS (Google Cloud Storage), provide one of two ways to authenticate:

#### [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) (Recommended)

you can send the report to your GCS bucket by running the command:

```shell
edr send-report --google-service-account-path <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH> --gcs-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

#### OAuth using `gcloud`

If you're using OAuth with `gcloud`, simply omit `--google-service-account-path`:

```shell
edr send-report --gcs-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

You can control the location of the report in the bucket by providing `--bucket-file-path <REPORT_PATH>` to
the `edr send-report` command. Make sure the report's file name ends with `.html`.

### Hosting the report as a website

You can host the report as the bucket's website so that you can browse to it with a constant URL
like `https://storage.googleapis.com/<Elementary-Report-Bucket>/index.html`.
Here's [an example](https://storage.googleapis.com/elementary_static/elementary_demo.html).
In order to do that, pass `--update-bucket-website true` to `send-report` in order to update the `index.html` file in
the bucket.

_Note_: You might want to [limit or grant access](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control) to your reports
bucket to certain users.

### Configuration in file

If you prefer to use `config.yml` file, you can add the following configuration instead of the CLI arguments:

```yml
google:
  service_account_path: [Google service account path]
  gcs_bucket_name: [GCS bucket name]

update_bucket_website: [true | false]
```

### Send report summary to Slack

In addition to hosting the report, you can send a [report summary notification to Slack](/oss/guides/share-observability-report/send-report-summary) every time the report is updated.
