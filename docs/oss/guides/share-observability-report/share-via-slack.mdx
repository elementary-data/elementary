You can share the report via Slack as html attachment.

By default, sharing the Slack message will include a [report summary](/oss/guides/share-observability-report/send-report-summary).

#### CLI `send-report` command

After you [set up a Slack app and token](/oss/deployment-and-configuration/slack#slack-integration-setup), run the command:

```shell
edr send-report --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME>
```

You can control the name of the report by using `--slack-file-name <REPORT_NAME>` (the report name you provide needs to ends with `.html`).

#### Configuration in file

If you prefer to use `config.yml` file, you can add the following configuration instead of the CLI arguments:

```yml
slack:
  token: [Slack token]
  channel_name: [Slack channel]
```
