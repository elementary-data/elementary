**Prerequisites**

- [AWS access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html)
- [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html)

</Info>

If you already have a [`~/.aws/credentials`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-where)
file, you can run the command and provide only the profile name and the bucket's name:

```shell
edr send-report --aws-profile-name <AWS_PROFILE> --s3-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

Alternatively, you can pass the access key ID and secret access key:

```shell
edr send-report --aws-access-key-id <ACCESS_KEY_ID> --aws-secret-access-key <SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> --s3-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

You can control the location of the report in the bucket by providing `--bucket-file-path <REPORT_PATH>` (the report's file name should end with `.html`).

### Hosting the report as a website

You can host the report as the bucket's website so that you can browse to it with a constant URL
like `https://<Elementary-Report-Bucket>.s3-website.<Region>.amazonaws.com`.
In order to do that, you'll need to complete **steps 1-4** on
the [configure a website on the bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html)
guide.
After you've completed it, pass `--update-bucket-website true` to `send-report` in order to update the main page of
the bucket's website.

### Configuration in file

If you prefer to use `config.yml` file, you can add the following configuration instead of the CLI arguments:

```yml
aws:
  profile_name: [AWS profile name]
  s3_bucket_name: [S3 bucket name]

update_bucket_website: [true | false]
```

### Send report summary to Slack

In addition to hosting the report, you can send a [report summary notification to Slack](/oss/guides/share-observability-report/send-report-summary) every time the report is updated.
