## Setup Teams Integration

<Info>

**Before you start**

Before you can start using the alerts, make sure to [install the dbt package](/oss/quickstart/quickstart-cli-package), [configure a profile and install the CLI](/oss/quickstart/quickstart-cli).
This is **required for the alerts to work.**

</Info>

<Snippet file="setup-teams-integration.mdx" />

## Execute the CLI

Make sure to run the following command after your dbt runs and tests:

```
edr monitor --teams-webhook <your_teams_webhook> --group-by [table | alert]
```

Or just `edr monitor` if you used `config.yml`.

## Alert on source freshness failures

_Not supported in dbt cloud_

To alert on source freshness, you will need to run `edr run-operation upload-source-freshness` right after each execution of `dbt source freshness`.
This operation will upload the results to a table, and the execution of `edr monitor` will send the actual alert.

- Note that `dbt source freshness` and `upload-source-freshness` needs to run from the same machine.
- Note that `upload-source-freshness` requires passing `--project-dir` argument.

## Continuous alerting

In order to monitor continuously, use your orchestrator to execute it regularly (we recommend running it right after
your dbt job ends to monitor the latest data updates).
