## Alerts CLI flags

#### Filter alerts

Elementary supports filtering alerts using a selector, and sending only the selected alerts.
You can filter the alerts by tag, owner or model.

If you run `edr` from the dbt project directory (or pass `--project-dir`), you can use any of the dbt selectors.

_Note_: alerts on skipped tests and models are filtered out by default. if you want to receive those alerts, apply the statuses filter and include them explicitly.

<CodeGroup>

```shell tag filter
edr monitor --select tag:critical
edr monitor --select tag:finance
```

```shell owner filter
edr monitor --select config.meta.owner:@jeff
edr monitor --select config.meta.owner:@jessy
```

```shell model filter
edr monitor --select model:customers
edr monitor --select model:orders

edr monitor --select customers
edr monitor --select orders
```

```shell statuses filter
edr monitor --select statuses:warn,fail
edr monitor --select statuses:error
edr monitor --select statuses:skipped
```

```shell resource_types filter
edr monitor --select resource_types:model
edr monitor --select resource_types:test
edr monitor --select resource_types:test,source_freshness
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Group alerts by table

By default, Elementary sends a single alert to notify on each failure with extensive information for fast triage.

Elementary also supports grouping alerts by table.
In this case, a single Slack notification will be generated containing all issues associated with this table.
The created notification will contain a union of the relevant owners, tags and subscribers.

Due to their nature, grouped alerts will contain less information on each issue.

```shell
edr monitor --group-by table
```

#### Suppression interval flag

Don’t want to get multiple alerts if the same test keeps failing?
You can now configure an alert_suppression_interval, this is a “snooze” period for alerts on the same issue.
Elementary won’t send new alerts on the same issue that are generated within suppression interval.

The flag configuration is the suppression interval duration in hours, and the default is 0 hours (no alert suppression).
If configured otherwise in the dbt project config block or meta, the CLI value will be ignored (unless `--override-dbt-project-config` is used).

```shell
edr monitor --suppression-interval 24
```
