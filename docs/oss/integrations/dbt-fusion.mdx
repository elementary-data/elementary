title: "dbt fusion (Beta)"
---

<Note>Note: dbt-fusion support in Elementary is still in beta, as is dbt-fusion itself. Please see below a list of features that are not yet implemented.</Note>

Elemmentary OSS integrates with dbt-fusion, starting with version 0.20.
Fusion is a complete rewrite of the dbt engine, and provides many benefits, including enhanced performance and static analysis. 

For more details about dbt-fusion capabilities, installation guidelines and migration best practices, please consult the [dbt-fusion docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/fusion/about-fusion).

### Supported Elementary capabilities

Most of the main capabilities of the Elementary dbt package are supported in Fusion, including:
1. Anomaly detection tests.
2. Schema tests.
3. Artifacts collection.

However, the following capabilities are not supported right now for dbt Fusion:
1. Python tests.
2. JSON schema tests.
3. The missing dbt-fusion features listed below.

### Missing features in dbt-fusion

In addition to the above, there are some features that are currently missing from dbt-fusion, and therefore are not yet available in the Elementary package.

For each one of the issues below, we've included a link to the dbt-fusion github repository - **please upvote these features if they are important to you!**

1. [Test compilation errors are not being reported](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/686) - If a test query fails, Elementary will report it as expected. 
However, if there is a compilation error / any error that comes before the actually test query ("error" status in dbt-core), it will currently be missing.
2. [Source freshness results are not reported](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/720)
3. [Group artifacts are not reported](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/25)
4. [Compiled code is missing from dbt artifact tables](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/723)
5. [Failed row count is missing from dbt artifact tables](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/724)
