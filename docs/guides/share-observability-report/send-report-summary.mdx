In addition to distributing the report itself, you can send a report summary notification to Slack.

This is useful for you and your team members to understand quickly if there is something in the new report you should address.

- **Share via Slack**: The summary is sent by default.
- **Hosting on S3 or GCS**: You need to provide slack token and channel to in order to enable the Slack results summary.

### Enabling report summary for hosted report 
 
After you [set up a Slack app and token](/integrations/slack#slack-integration-setup) you can run the following command:

AWS S3:
```shell
edr send-report --aws-profile-name <AWS_PROFILE> --s3-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME> --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME>
```

GCS:
```shell  
edr send-report --google-service-account-path <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH> --gcs-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME> --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME>  
```  

A link to the hosted report is included in the summary, which can be accessed based on the permissions you have set on your hosting platform (AWS/GCS).


### Report summary configuration 

#### Filter results summary

You can filter your results summary by a specific tag, owner or model.

To filter by tag:
```shell send-report selectors
edr send-report --select tag:finance
edr send-report --select config.meta.owner:@jeff
edr send-report --select model:customers
edr send-report --select customers
```

#### Include test descriptions

For a quick high level overview and to avoid reaching Slack's row limit, the default test results summary does not include test descriptions.
The test descriptions can be included in your summary, but it is only recommended if you have a small number of failures.

The following `include` configuration will allow you to add descriptions:

```shell
edr send-report --include descriptions
```
