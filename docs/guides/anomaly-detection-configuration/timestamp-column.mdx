`timestamp_column: [column name]`

<Tip>If your data set has a timestamp column that represents the creation time of a field, it is highly recommended configuring it as a `timestamp_column`.</Tip>

Elementary anomaly detection tests will use this column to create time buckets and filter the table.
It is highly recommended to configure a timestamp column (if there is one).
The best column for this would be an `updated_at`/`created_at`/`loaded_at` timestamp for each row (date type also works).

If undefined, default is null (no time buckets).

- _Default: none_
- _Relevant tests: All anomaly detection tests_
- _Configuration level: model config, test config_
