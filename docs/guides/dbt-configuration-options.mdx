title: "DBT Configuration Options and Variables"

This page provides a comprehensive guide to the configuration options and variables available in DBT. Each option and variable is explained in detail, along with its allowed values.

## Configuration Options

### full-refresh-dbt-package
This option forces a full refresh of all incremental models in the edr dbt package. It is usually not needed, and you can learn more in the documentation. The allowed values are `True` and `False`.

### dbt-vars
This option allows you to specify a raw YAML string of your dbt variables. The allowed value is a string.

### test
This option determines whether to send a test message in case there are no alerts. The allowed values are `True` and `False`.

### suppression-interval
This option sets the number of hours to suppress alerts after an alert was sent. This is a global default setting. The allowed value is an integer.
