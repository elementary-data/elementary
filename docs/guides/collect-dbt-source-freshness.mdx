You can leverage Elementary to send Slack notifications on failures in [dbt source freshness](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/source-freshness) checks.

<Warning>
  Since dbt 1.3.2 this collecting source freshness results is only supported in
  dbt core, not in dbt cloud.
</Warning>

Elementary data observability report currently does not show this results, only the results of Elementary [freshness anomalies](/data-tests/anomaly-detection-tests/freshness-anomalies) tests.

## Alert on source freshness failures

_Not supported in dbt cloud_

To alert on source freshness, you will need to run the following command:

```shell
edr run-operation upload-source-freshness --project-dir <path to your project>
```

The command needs to be executed after you run `dbt source freshness` and before executing `edr monitor`.

This operation will upload the results to a table, and the execution of `edr monitor` will send the actual alert.

- Note that `dbt source freshness` and `upload-source-freshness` needs to run from the same machine.
- Note that `upload-source-freshness` requires passing `--project-dir` argument.
