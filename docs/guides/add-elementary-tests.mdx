title: "Add anomaly detection tests"
---

After you [install the dbt package](/quickstart#install-the-dbt-package), you can add Elementary data anomaly detection tests.

## Data anomaly detection dbt tests

Elementary dbt package includes **anomaly detection tests, implemented as [dbt tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests)**.
These tests can detect anomalies in volume, freshness, null rates, and anomalies in specific dimensions, among others.
The tests are configured and executed like any other tests in your project.

## Available anomaly detection tests

### Table (model / source) tests

#### Volume (row count) anomalies

`elementary.volume_anomalies`

Monitors the row count of your table over time per time bucket (if configured without `timestamp_column`, will count table total rows).

Upon running the test, your data is split into time buckets (daily by default, configurable with the `time bucket`
field), and then we compute the row count per bucket for the last [`days_back`](/guides/anomaly-detection-configuration/days-back) days (by default 14).

The test then compares the row count of each bucket buckets within the detection period (last 2 days by default, controlled by the
`backfill_days` var), and compares it to the row count of the previous time buckets.
If there were any anomalies during the detection period, the test will fail.

For advanced configuration of Elementary anomaly tests, refer to [tests configuration](/guides/elementary-tests-configuration).

```

#### Freshness anomalies

`elementary.freshness_anomalies`

Monitors the freshness of your table over time, as the expected time between data updates.

Upon running the test, your data is split into time buckets (daily by default, configurable with the `time bucket`
field), and then we compute the maximum freshness value per bucket for the last `days_back` days (by default 14).

The test then compares the freshness of each bucket within the detection period (last 2 days by default, controlled by the
`backfill_days` var), and compares it to the freshness of the previous time buckets.
If there were any anomalies during the detection period, the test will fail.

For advanced configuration of Elementary anomaly tests, refer to [tests configuration](/guides/elementary-tests-configuration).

```yml Models

          where_expression: < sql expression >

          tags: ["elementary"]
          config:
            # optional - change severity
            severity: warn
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Event freshness anomalies

`elementary.event_freshness_anomalies`

Monitors the freshness of event data over time, as the expected time it takes each event to load -
that is, the time between the when the event actually occurs (the event timestamp), and when it is loaded to the
database (the update timestamp).

This test compliments the `freshness_anomalies` test and is primarily intended for data that is updated in a
continuous / streaming fashion.

The test can work in a couple of modes:

- If only an `event_timestamp_column` is supplied, the test measures over time the difference between the current
  timestamp ("now") and the most recent event timestamp.
- If both an `event_timestamp_column` and an `update_timestamp_column` are provided, the test will measure over time
  the difference between these two columns.

For advanced configuration of Elementary anomaly tests, refer to [tests configuration](/guides/elementary-tests-configuration).

models:
  - name: < model name >
    tests:
      - elementary.event_freshness_anomalies:
          event_timestamp_column: < timestamp column > # Mandatory
          update_timestamp_column: < timestamp column > # Optional
          where_expression: < sql expression >
          time_bucket: # Daily by default
            period: < time period >
            count: < number of periods >
```

          update_timestamp_column: "updated_at"
          # optional - use tags to run elementary tests on a dedicated run
          tags: ["elementary"]
          config:
            # optional - change severity
            severity: warn
```

#### Dimension anomalies

`elementary.dimension_anomalies`

This test monitors the frequency of values in the configured dimension over time, and alerts on unexpected changes in
the distribution.
It is best to configure it on low-cardinality fields.
The test counts rows grouped by given columns/expressions, and can be configured using the `dimensions`
and `where_expression` keys.

For advanced configuration of Elementary anomaly tests, refer to [tests configuration](/guides/elementary-tests-configuration).

are [detailed here](/guides/data-anomaly-detection#tests-and-monitors-types) and can be configured using
the `all_columns_anomalies` key.

## Configure your elementary anomaly detection tests

<Tip>
  If your data set has a timestamp column that represents the creation time of a
  field, it is highly recommended configuring it as a `timestamp_column`.
</Tip>

To support different types of data sets, the tests have configuration that can be used to customize their behavior.
Read more about [data anomaly detection tests configuration here](/guides/elementary-tests-configuration).

We recommend adding a tag to the tests so you could execute these in a dedicated run using the selection parameter `--select tag:elementary`.
If you wish to only be warned on anomalies, configure the `severity` of the tests to `warn`.

## What happens on each test?

Upon running a test, your data is split into time buckets based on the [`time_bucket`](/guides/anomaly-detection-configuration/time-bucket) field and is limited by
the [`days_back`](/guides/anomaly-detection-configuration/days-back) var. The test then compares a certain metric (e.g. row count) of the buckets that are within the detection
period ([`backfill_days`](/guides/anomaly-detection-configuration/backfill-days)) to the row count of all the previous time buckets within the [`days_back`](/guides/anomaly-detection-configuration/days-back) period.
If there were any anomalies in the detection period, the test will fail.
On each test elementary package executes the relevant monitors, and searches for anomalies by comparing to historical metrics.

## What does it mean when a test fails?

When a test fail, it means that an anomaly was detected on this metric and dataset. To learn more, refer to [core concepts](/guides/how-anomaly-detection-works) and [anomaly detection](/guides/data-anomaly-detection).
