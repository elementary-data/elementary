For the data monitoring and dbt artifacts collection, edr executes a dbt package we developed.
The package adds modles, macros, and Elementary monitors as dbt tests to your project.

(Not a dbt user? you can still use Elementary, reach out to us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/elementary-community/shared_invite/zt-uehfrq2f-zXeVTtXrjYRbdE_V6xq4Rg) and we will help)

<Accordion title="What are dbt packages and packages.yml?">
A dbt package is additional Jinja and SQL code that is added to your project, for additional functionality. In fact, each package is a dbt project. By adding a package to your project, you are adding the package code to be part of your project, you can reference it's macros, execute it's models, and so on.

Add packages to your project by creating a 'packages.yml' file under the main project directory (where your 'dbt_project.yml is), and adding the relevant package. After you add a new package, run dbt deps to actually pull it's code to your project. This is also how you update packages.
Some packages we recommend you check out: [dbt_utils](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/tree/0.8.2/), [dbt_date](https://github.com/calogica/dbt-date/tree/0.5.4/), [codegen](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/tree/0.5.0/).

The package contains models, macros, dbt artifacts uploader and data monitors as dbt tests. The impact of the package on `dbt run` is minimal, and most of the processing happens as part of the data monitors as dbt tests, that are executed on `dbt test`.

To start, refer to the [installation guide](../quickstart#how-to-install-elementary-dbt-package) of the dbt package.

The code of the Elementary dbt package can be found here:
