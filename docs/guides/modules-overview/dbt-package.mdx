The Elementary dbt package serves as a collector of logs and metadata from your dbt project and offers a set of data anomaly detection and schema tests.
To gain the most value from the dbt package, we recommend using it with the [Elementary Cloud Platform](/cloud/introduction) or with [Elementary open-source CLI tool](/oss/oss-introduction).

**What brings you here?**

* **An organizational data quality initiative** (e.g., platform refactoring, governance projects, or AI/ML adoption): The Elementary Cloud Platform offers pipeline monitoring, incident management, lineage tracking, dashboards, health scores, and alerts, empowering data engineers, analytics engineers, and data analysts to resolve issues efficiently and deliver trusted data products. Learn more about the [Elementary Cloud Platform](/cloud/introduction) or [book a demo](https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/joost-boonzajer-flaes/intro-call-docs).

* **Individual-use observability:** If you’ll be the primary user, try the open-source CLI tool to send Slack alerts, and self-host the Elementary report.

The repository and source code of the Elementary dbt package can be [found here](https://github.com/elementary-data/dbt-data-reliability).

## Package Features

The Elementary dbt package is designed to power data observability use cases for dbt pipelines.
This package will upload logs and metadata generated from your runs as dbt artifacts into tables in your datawarehouse.
Additionally, it offers a wide range of tests, including anomalies in volume, freshness, columns and different dimensions of your data.

The impact of the package on **`dbt run`** is minimal, and most of the processing happens as part of the data tests that are executed on **`dbt test`**.

<Accordion title="What are dbt packages and packages.yml?">
  A dbt package is additional Jinja and SQL code that is added to your project, for additional functionality. In fact, each package is a dbt project. By adding a package to your project, you are adding the package code to be part of your project, you can reference its macros, execute its models, and so on.

  Add packages to your project by creating a `packages.yml` file under the main project directory (where your `
  dbt_project.yml` is), and adding the relevant package. After you add a new package, run `dbt deps` to actually pull its
  code to your project. This is also how you update packages.
  Some packages we recommend you check out: [dbt\_utils](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/tree/0.8.2/)
  , [dbt\_date](https://github.com/calogica/dbt-date/tree/0.5.4/)
  , [codegen](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/tree/0.5.0/).
</Accordion>

After you deploy the dbt package, you can use Elementary tests, and your dbt artifacts will be uploaded automatically with on-run-end hooks:

  <Card title="on-run-end hooks" href="/dbt/on-run-end_hooks" />
</CardGroup>

Although you can use the package only, we recommend using it with Elementary Cloud or OSS.

## Package full refresh

Elementary incremental models are not full-refreshed by default. This is because these models contain
information such as historical runs and test results, which typically you'd want to maintain even when full refreshing
the models of your main dbt project.

However, if you wish to change this behavior and include Elementary models as a part of the full refresh, you can set
the following var:

```yaml
vars:
  elementary_full_refresh: true
```
