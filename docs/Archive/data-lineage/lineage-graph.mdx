title: 'Lineage graph'
---

After generating data lineage using `edr lineage generate` command, you now have a local file with all your lineage graph.

To visualize the graph, run `edr lineage`

If the browser does not open (happens on some computers), try running `edr lineage -o true`

If your graph is big and you wish to filter it, refer to [dataset filters](#options-dataset-filters).

Note that all these commands are executed against your local lineage file and not the data warehouse.

If you wish to see updated data or filter on different timeframe / databases, run `edr lineage generate` again.

## Options: Dataset filters

CLI options for filtering the datasets in the graph

Sometimes the graph is too big, and you would want to filter it to more easily answer specific questions such as:

- What tables are affected by a change in this table?
- Where might be the source of a problem in this table?

For that, you can use the following filters to get a graph that better fits your needs:

- **Database filter:**

  Filters on the selected database to see the graph that describes only this db's lineage information.

```
-db, --database <TEXT>
```

- **Schema filter:**

  Filters on the selected schema to see the graph that describes only this schema's lineage information. Note that the schema must be in the database that you filter on.

```
-sch, --schema +<TEXT>+
```

- **Table filter:**

  Filters on the selected table to see the graph that describes only this table's lineage information. Note that the table must be in the database that you filter on.

  - You can use 'table' or 'schema.table' format.

```
-t, --table +<TEXT>+
```

- **Direction:**

  Filters on a direction of dependencies when filtering on a specific table.

  - If undefined, default is `both`.

  - This filter must be configured with a table/schema/db filter.

```
# downstream
<dataset>+

# upstream
+<dataset>

# both (default)
+<dataset>+

# Creates the graph only for upstream lineage of 'my_db.some_schema.a_table'
edr lineage -t +my_db.some_schema.a_table
```

- **Depth:**
  
  Filters on how many levels of dependencies to show when filtering on a specific table.
  - If undefined, default will show all dependencies.
  - This filter must be configured with a table / schema / db filter and direction.

```
# downstream depth limited to 2
<dataset>+2

# upstream depth limited to 10
10+<dataset>

# Creates the graph with only 2 level depth upstream
# lineage for 'some_schema.a_table'
edr lineage 2+my_db.some_schema.a_table
```

## Options: Others

Additional CLI options

- **Open browser:**

Indicates if the lineage graph should be opened in your default browser or just saved as a local `elementary-lineage.html` file in your current directory.

- If undefined, default is true.
- The local file is created in both of the configurations.

```
-o, --open-browser BOOLEAN

# Creates the graph without opening the browser

edr lineage -db my_db -o false
```

- **Export query history:**

Indicates if the queries used to generate the graph should be exported to a file in your current directory.

- If undefined, default is false.
- The exported file is named latest_query_history.json.

```
-h, --export-query-history BOOLEAN

# Exports the query history

edr lineage -db my_db -h true
```

- **Full table names:**

Indicates if the names of the tables on the graph should display the full qualified name including the database and schema names (db.schema.table_name instead of just table_name).

- If undefined, default is false.

```
-n, --full-table-names BOOLEAN

# Creates the graph with full table names

edr lineage -db my_db -n true
```
