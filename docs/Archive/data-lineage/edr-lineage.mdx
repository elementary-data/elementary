title: "edr lineage"
---

After you successfully [installed Elementary](../understand-elementary/cli-install#install-and-configure), [configured a connection profile](../understand-elementary/cli-install#cli-configuration) and provided the permissions required to access the [query history](), it's time to create your data lineage graph using the lineage CLI.

```shell
edr lineage
```

## edr lineage

### Commands

The lineage module has two commands:

```
# This command generates a lineage graph local file

edr lineage generate

# This command reads the local lineage file and opens a browser visualization
edr lineage
```

Note that if a graph file exists localy, edr will always read it by default.

Every time you want to create a new updated graph, use `edr lineage generate`.

### Command examples

```
# The tool is named edr (Elementary Data Reliability)
# Creates a lineage graph from queries executed between 2021-09-14 and current time,
# for the database my_db

edr lineage generate -s 2021-09-14 -dbs my_db

# Opens the graph in browser filtered on my_table downstream direction
edr lineage -t my_table+
```

### CLI options

When running the CLI, the following options may / should be used:

- [lineage generate](#edr-lineage-generate) - generate the graph from the query history of the selected dbs.

  - [Timeframe filters](#timeframe-filters) - options for filtering the query history timeframe in lineage generate.

- [Dataset filters](./lineage-graph#options-dataset-filters) - options for filtering the datasets in the graph.

- [Others](./lineage-graph#options-others) - additional execution options (table names, queries export, etc.).

The options for using the CLI, are all available and documented also when using

```
edr lineage --help
```

## edr lineage generate

**The generate command is used to create a local graph file.**

The graph visualization is generated from this local file. Each time you want a new updated graph, an execution of `edr lineage generate` is required.

**The only required option you must provide for generating lineage is the database name for which you want to create the lineage graph:**

```
-dbs, --databases <TEXT>

# Usage example
edr lineage generate -dbs my_db,another_db
```

### Timeframe filters

The lineage is created from the data warehouse [query history](./query-history-1) and access history, and the timeframe filters are used to define which queries to include in the graph.

The times are relevant to the **timezone in which the data warehouse is configured.**

- **Start date:**
  The starting time of the timeframe for which query history will be used for the lineage graph.

  - The time is relevant to the timezone in which the data warehouse is configured.

  - If undefined, the default is 7 days ago.

```
-s, --start-date [%Y-%m-%d|%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S]
```

- **End date:**

  The ending time of the timeframe for which query history will be used for the lineage graph.

  - The time is relevant to the timezone in which the data warehouse is configured.

  - If undefined, the default is the current time.

```
-e, --end-date [%Y-%m-%d|%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S]

```
