#### Anomaly Detection

<Card title="Automated Volume & Freshness Monitors">
  Out-of-the-box ML-powered monitoring for freshness and volume issues on all production tables.
  The monitors track updates to tables, and will detect data delays, incomplete updates, and significant volume changes.\
  By qurying only metadata (e.g. information schema, query history), the monitors don't add compute costs.
</Card>

<Card title="Opt-in Anomaly Detection Monitors">
  ML-powered anomaly detection on data quality metrics such as null rate, empty values, string length, numeric metrics (sum, max, min, avg), etc.
  Elementary also supports monitoring for anomalies by dimensions.
  The monitors are activated for specific data sets, and require minimal configuration (e.g. timestamp column, dimensions).
</Card>

#### Schema Validation

<Card title="Schema Tests">
  Elementary offers a set of schema tests for validating there are no breaking changes.
  The tests support detecting any schema changes, only detecting changes from a configured baseline, JSON schema validation,
  and schema changes that break downstream exposures such as dashboards.
