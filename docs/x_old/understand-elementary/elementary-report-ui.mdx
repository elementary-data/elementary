title: "Data observability report"
---

Elementary has a UI for visualization and exploration of data from
the [dbt-package](/guides/modules-overview/dbt-package) tables, which includes dbt
test results, Elementary anomaly detection results, dbt artifacts, etc.

In order to visualize the data from
the [dbt-package](/general/contributions#contributing-to-the-dbt-package) tables, use
the [CLI](/understand-elementary/cli-install) you can generate the Elementary UI.
After installing and configuring the CLI, execute the command:

```shell
edr report
```

The command will use the provided connection profile to access the data warehouse, read from the Elementary tables, and
generate the UI as an HTML file.

## Report Screens

### Test Results

The `Test results` tab shows the latest result for each dbt or Elementary test that was executed in the last 7 days (Can
be changed by passing `--days-back` param to the [CLI](/oss/cli-commands)).

Initially, the report presents all tests, sorted by status (failures on top) and last run time. The grey header on the
top of the screen shows the total amount of results of each status.

#### Navigation bar

The navigation bar on left shows a folder structure of your dbt project. On the right of each model/source you can see
the amount of each test result for the specific model / source. Choosing a specific model will show the details of the
selected model results. The grey header details and status totals also change accordingly.

On the top of the navigation bar, you will find filters to present only tests of the selected result status. The
selection filters both the navigation bar and the report.

#### Test results table

Each row in the table represents a single dbt test, or a single Elementary anomaly.
The rows are expandable, and on expansion show information that can help understand and triage the result:

- For Elementary anomaly tests - Anomaly detection graph, test attributes, query that returns the underlying metrics.
- For dbt tests - Table with results sample, test params, error message, query that returns all the results.
- For schema changes tests - detected schema changes.

## Test runs

The `Test runs` tab shows the last 30 runs (can be changed by passing `--executions-limit` param to
the [CLI](/oss/cli-commands#cli-advanced-options)) for each dbt or Elementary test that was executed in the last 7 days (
can be changed by passing `--days-back` param to the [CLI](/oss/cli-commands#cli-advanced-options)).

Initially, the report presents all tests, sorted by results (results containing failures on top), fail rate and last run
time. The grey header on the top of the screen shows the total amount of runs for each status.

### Navigation bar

The navigation bar on left shows a folder structure of your dbt project. On the right of each model/source you can see
the amount of each tests runs for the specific table. Choosing a specific model presents a report of the selected model
only. The grey header details and status totals also change accordingly.

On the top of the navigation bar, you will find filters to present only tests of the selected result status. The
selection filters both the navigation bar and the report.

### Test runs table

Each row in the table represents a single dbt test, or a single Elementary anomaly.
The rows are expandable, and on expansion show information about the last runs of the tests:

- Run status
- Affected rows
- Time

## Data lineage navigation bar

<div className="inline">

When selecting a dbt model/source in the navigation bar, a lineage icon will appear next to the
selected dbt model/source:

<img className="m-0 float-right" src="/pics/lineage_icon.png" width="18" />

</div>

Pressing on the lineage icon will toggle the navigation bar into a lineage navigation bar mode.

The lineage navigation bar lets you inspect upstream and downstream failures based on the selected model/source lineage!

This is useful when trying to find the root cause of a test failure or when trying to understand what is the impact of a
test failure, for example on an exposure or a dashboard in the data stack.

## Configure report sharing

The data tests report UI can be sent via Slack, Google Cloud Storage, or Amazon S3 when you
run `edr send-report`.

Refer to [this guide](/quickstart/share-report-ui) for detailed instructions.
