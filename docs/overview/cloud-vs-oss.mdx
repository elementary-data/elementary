### Elementary Cloud
Ideal for teams monitoring mission-critical data pipelines, requiring guaranteed uptime and reliability, short-time-to-value, advanced features, collaboration, and professional support. The solution is secure by design, and requires no access to your data from cloud.

### Elementary Community
An open-source CLI tool you can deploy and orchestrate to send Slack alerts and self-host the Elementary report. It is best for data and analytics engineers that require basic observability capabilities or for evaluating features without vendor approval.
