The Elementary Python SDK uses API key authentication to securely send data to Elementary Cloud.

## Getting Your Credentials

### Generate an Access Token

You can generate tokens directly from the Elementary UI:

1. Go to [User → Personal Tokens](https://app.elementary-data.com/settings/user-tokens) or [Account → Account Tokens](https://app.elementary-data.com/settings/account-tokens)
2. Click **Generate token**
3. (Optional) Add a name/description for the token
4. Copy the token and store it securely — **it is shown only once**

### Required Credentials

You'll need the following:
- **Project ID** - Your Python project identifier (this will appear in the metadata of the assets you report)
- **API Key** - Your API token (generated from the steps above)
- **URL** - The full SDK ingest endpoint URL: `{base_url}/sdk-ingest/{env_id}/batch`

<Tip>
The same token generation process is used for other Elementary integrations. See the [MCP Setup Guide](/cloud/mcp/setup-guide#1--generate-an-access-token) for more details.
</Tip>

## Configuring Authentication

### Using the Client

When initializing the `ElementaryCloudClient`, provide your credentials:

```python
from elementary_python_sdk.core.cloud.cloud_client import ElementaryCloudClient

PROJECT_ID = "my-python-project"  # Your Python project identifier (used to deduplicate and identify assets)
API_KEY = "your-api-token"
URL = "https://app.elementary-data.com/sdk-ingest/{env_id}/batch"

client = ElementaryCloudClient(PROJECT_ID, API_KEY, URL)
```

**Note:** 
- The `URL` parameter should be the full endpoint URL including the environment ID. Replace `{env_id}` with your actual environment ID.
- `PROJECT_ID` is your Python project identifier (chosen by you, used to deduplicate and identify reported assets in Elementary Cloud).

### Using Environment Variables

For better security, use environment variables:

```python
import os
from elementary_python_sdk.core.cloud.cloud_client import ElementaryCloudClient

PROJECT_ID = os.getenv("ELEMENTARY_PROJECT_ID")
API_KEY = os.getenv("ELEMENTARY_API_KEY")
URL = os.getenv("ELEMENTARY_URL")  # Full endpoint URL: https://app.elementary-data.com/sdk-ingest/{env_id}/batch

client = ElementaryCloudClient(PROJECT_ID, API_KEY, URL)
```

Set the environment variables:

```bash
export ELEMENTARY_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
export ELEMENTARY_API_KEY="your-api-token"
export ELEMENTARY_URL="https://app.elementary-data.com/sdk-ingest/{env_id}/batch"
```

### Using a Configuration File

You can also store credentials in a configuration file (not recommended for production):

```python
import json
from elementary_python_sdk.core.cloud.cloud_client import ElementaryCloudClient

with open("elementary_config.json") as f:
    config = json.load(f)

client = ElementaryCloudClient(
    config["project_id"],
    config["api_key"],
    config["url"]  # Full endpoint URL
)
```

## Security Best Practices

<Tip>
Never commit API tokens to version control. Always use environment variables or secrets management systems.
</Tip>

1. **Use environment variables** - Store tokens in environment variables, not in code
2. **Use secrets management** - For production, use services like AWS Secrets Manager, HashCorp Vault, or similar
3. **Rotate tokens regularly** - Periodically rotate your API tokens for better security
4. **Limit token scope** - Create API tokens with minimal required permissions
5. **Monitor usage** - Regularly check API token usage in your Elementary Cloud account

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

If you receive a 401 error:

- Verify your API token is correct
- Check that the token hasn't been revoked
- Ensure you're using the correct URL

### 404 Not Found

If you receive a 404 error:

- Verify your URL is correct and includes the correct environment ID
- Check that the environment exists in your Elementary Cloud account
- Ensure you have access to the environment
