You will connect Elementary Cloud to Bigquery for syncing the Elementary schema (created by the [Elementary dbt package](/cloud/onboarding/quickstart-dbt-package)).

### Create a user for Elementary cloud

- Create the service account ([docs](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview)).
- Grant it the `roles/bigquery.jobUser` role on the project ([docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery_iam_roles)).
- Grant it the `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` role on your elementary dataset (usually `<dbt_dataset>_elementary`).
- Grant it the `roles/bigquery.metadataViewer` role on your dbt dataset.
