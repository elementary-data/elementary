1. You install the Elementary dbt package in your dbt project and configure it to write to it's own schema, the Elementary schema.
2. The package writes test results, run results, logs and metadata to the Elementary schema.
3. The cloud service only requires `read access` to the Elementary schema, not to schemas where your sensitive data is stored.
4. The cloud service connects to sync the Elementary schema using an **encrypted connection** and a **static IP address** that you will need to add to your allowlist.
