Once you start sharing data with downstream consumers and stakeholders one of the most important things that you want to create is trust.
Trust that the data that is being used is “healthy”. Imagine being a data analyst using a specific data asset but you constantly run into data quality issues.
You will eventually lose trust.

This is why we created **data health scores** in Elementary. It is a way to share an overview of the health of your data assets.

To measure health we use an industry standard framework of [Data Quality Dimensions](cloud/features/collaboration-and-communication/data-quality-dimensions#data-quality-dimensions).
These dimensions help assess the reliability of data in various business contexts.
Ensuring high-quality data across these dimensions is critical for accurate analysis, informed decision-making, and operational efficiency.
