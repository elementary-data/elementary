- **Anomaly Direction** - Whether you want the monitor to fail on anomalous drops, spikes, or both. Default is both.
- **Sensitivity** -  You can set the monitor's sensitivity levels to *Low*, *Medium*, or *High*. In the future, we plan to allow for more nuanced adjustments to this parameter. You can use the `Simulate Configuration` button for testing how the change will affect the monitor.
- **Detection Period** - The period in which the monitor look for anomalies. Default is the last 2 days.
