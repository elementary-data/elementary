dbt tests are very powerful. The ease of use, simplicity, and usefulness in the dev process is unmatched.
When you adopt any observability tool, you will still use dbt tests. This is why in Elementary, dbt tests are first class citizens.

There are several benefits to this approach:

- **Single interface for all observability** - Prevent the distribution of monitoring between different tools. All configuration is in code, all the results are in one interface.
- **Avoid duplicate work and vendor lock in** - The tests you implemented already are effective in Elementary, as well as additional configuration. The future tests you add will remain in your code if you decide to offboard.
- **Control of schedule and cost** - You have control of configuration and scheduling, tests can be executed when data is actually loaded and validation is needed.
- **Prevent bad data from propagating** - As tests are in pipeline, you can leverage `dbt build` and fail the pipeline on critical test failures.
- **Rich ecosystem** - The community of dbt users developes and supports various testing use cases.
