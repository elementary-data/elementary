### Why choose Elementary Cloud?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Built for data developers" icon="code" iconType="solid">
    Elementary configuration is managed in your dbt code. 
    Elementary Cloud syncs configuration changes from the UI back to the dbt project code repository.

    You won't need to duplicate configuration - all your existing tests, owners, tags, and descriptions are leveraged.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secure by design" icon="lock" iconType="solid">
    Elementary Cloud can't access your data.

    The dbt package creates a schema for logs, results and metadata, and Elementary only requires access to the Elementary schema.

### Elementary Cloud integrations

<Snippet file="cloud/integrations/cards-groups/cloud-integrations-cards.mdx" />

### How does it work?

The Elementary dbt package runs as part of your dbt invocations.
The package collects and stores data such as run results, test results, anomaly detection results and more.

This data is saved to an Elementary schema in the DWH.
The Elementary cloud service requires access only to this schema, to connect and generates a report UI and Slack alerts.
