### Detection & Coverage

Elementary integrates powerful anomaly detection and dbt tests into a unified detection strategy.
Effective data issues detection requires a comprehensive approach,
including both pipeline and data monitoring, validation tests,
anomaly detection for unexpected behavior, and a single interface to manage it all at scale.

### Triage & Response

Detecting issues is just the first step to achieve data reliability.
Elementary offers tools to create an effective response plan, for faster recovery.
This includes investigating issues root cause and impact, communicating issues to the relevant people, assigning owners to fix issues, keeping track of open incidents and more.
