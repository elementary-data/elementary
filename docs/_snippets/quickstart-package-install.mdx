To start using Elementary to monitor you tests, executions and data, you need to add our dbt package to your dbt project.

<Accordion title="What are dbt packages and packages.yml?">
A dbt package is additional Jinja and SQL code that is added to your project, for additional functionality. In fact, each package is a dbt project. By adding a package to your project, you are adding the package code to be part of your project, you can reference its macros, execute its models, and so on.

Add packages to your project by creating a `packages.yml` file under the main project directory (where your `dbt_project.yml` is), and adding the relevant package. After you add a new package, run `dbt deps` to actually pull its code to your project. This is also how you update packages.
Some packages we recommend you check out: [dbt_utils](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/tree/0.8.2/), [dbt_date](https://github.com/calogica/dbt-date/tree/0.5.4/), [codegen](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/tree/0.5.0/).

## Install dbt package

### 1. Add elementary to `packages.yml`

Add the following to your `packages.yml` file (if missing, create it where `dbt_project.yml` is):

<Info>

Make sure to copy the packages that are relevant to your dbt version.

</Info>

**For dbt 1.3.0 and above:**

```yml packages.yml
packages:
  - package: elementary-data/elementary
    version: 0.10.0
    ## Docs: https://docs.elementary-data.com
```

**For dbt >=1.2.0 \<1.3.0:**

```yml packages.yml
packages:
  - package: elementary-data/elementary
    version: 0.10.0
    ## Docs: https://docs.elementary-data.com

    ## !! Important !! For dbt >=1.2.0 \<1.3.0 ##
    ## (Prevents dbt_utils versions exceptions) ##
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
    version: [">=0.8.0", "<1.0.0"]
```

**For dbt >=1.0.0 \<1.2.0:**

```yml packages.yml
packages:
  - package: elementary-data/elementary
    version: 0.10.0
    ## Docs: https://docs.elementary-data.com

    ## !! Important !! For dbt <1.2.0 ##
    ## (Prevents dbt_utils versions exceptions) ##
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
    version: [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"]
```

### 2. Add to your `dbt_project.yml`

<Info>
This means Elementary models will have their own schema.
Depending on your project custom schema rules (see [dbt custom schema docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/custom-schemas)), the schema will be named `elementary` or `<target_schema>_elementary` (being `<target_schema> = analytics` very often).

Make sure your user (or the orchestrator user) has permissions to create schemas.
If not, ask your admin to create both schemas and grant permissions to the relevant users / groups.

</Info>

```yml dbt_project.yml
models:
  ## see docs: https://docs.elementary-data.com/
  elementary:
    ## elementary models will be created in the schema '<your_schema>_elementary'
    +schema: "elementary"
    ## To disable elementary for dev, uncomment this:
    # enabled: "{{ target.name in ['prod','analytics'] }}"
```

### 3. Import the package

```shell Terminal
dbt deps
```

### 4. Run to create the package models

```shell Terminal
dbt run --select elementary
```

This will mostly create empty tables, that will be updated with artifacts, metrics and test results in your future dbt executions.
