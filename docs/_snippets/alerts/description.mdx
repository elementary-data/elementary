Elementary supports configuring description for tests that are included in alerts.
It's recommended to add an explanation of what does it mean if this test fails, so alert will include this context.

```yml test
tests:
  - not_null:
    meta:
      description: "This is the test description"
```

```yml test config block
{{ config(
    tags=["Tag1","Tag2"]
    meta={
        description: "This is the test description"
    }
) }}
```

```yml dbt_project.yml
tests:
  path:
    subfolder:
      +meta:
        description: "This is the test description"
```
