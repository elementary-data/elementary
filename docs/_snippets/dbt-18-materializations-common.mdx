Starting from dbt 1.8 and above, 3rd party dbt packages cannot override dbt materializations without an explicit configuration from users.
Elementary utilizes this dbt mechanism to add reporting functionality to non-Elementary tests (such as native dbt tests and expectations):
* Collection of the total number of failed rows.
* Collection of failed row samples.
