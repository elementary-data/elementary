## Configuring the Elementary Profile

In order to connect, Elementary needs a [connection profile](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile) in a file named `profiles.yml`.
This profile will be used by the CLI, to connect to the DWH and find the dbt package tables.

The easiest way to generate the profile is to run the following command within the dbt project where you deployed the elementary dbt package (works in dbt cloud as well):

```shell
dbt run-operation elementary.generate_elementary_cli_profile
```

<Warning>
  Ensure that you fill in your password and any other missing fields after you
  paste the profile in your **local** `profiles.yml` file.
</Warning>
Copy the output, fill in the missing fields and add the profile to your `profiles.yml`.
Here is a demonstration:

      mozAllowFullScreen
      allowfullscreen
      style={{
        position: "absolute",
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
      }}
    ></iframe>
