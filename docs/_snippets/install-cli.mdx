## Install Elementary CLI

To install the monitor module run:

```shell
pip install elementary-data
```

Run one of the following commands based on your platform (no need to run all):

```shell
pip install 'elementary-data[snowflake]'
pip install 'elementary-data[bigquery]'
pip install 'elementary-data[redshift]'
pip install 'elementary-data[databricks]'
pip install 'elementary-data[athena]'
## Postgres doesn't require this step
```

Run `edr --help` in order to ensure the installation was successful.

If you're receiving `command not found: edr` please check our [troubleshooting guide](/general/troubleshooting).
