<Accordion title="How test configurations are prioritized?">

The configuration of Elementary is dbt native and follows the same priorities of `dbt configuration`.
The more granular and specific configuration overrides the less granular one. 

Elementary searches and prioritizes configuration in the following order:

For models:
1. Test arguments.
2. Model configuration.
3. Global vars in `dbt_project.yml`.

For sources:
1. Test arguments.
2. Table configuration.
3. Source configuration.
4. Global vars in `dbt_project.yml`.
