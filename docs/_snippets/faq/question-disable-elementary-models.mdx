<Accordion title="Can I disable / exclude the Elementary models?">

Elementary only needs you to run the models once after you install, and on upgrades of minor versions (like 0.15.X -> 0.16.X).
On such upgrades we make schema changes, so we need you to rebuild the tables.

For excluding the elementary models from your runs we suggest 2 options:

1. Use the selector `--exclude elementary` when you run `dbt run`.
2. Set a var that disables the models by default. On version upgrades you could pass it as true.

Here is how you implement option 2:

- on your `dbt_project.yml` add:

```yaml dbt_project.yml
models:
  elementary:
    +schema: elementary
    edr:
      +enabled: "{{ var('enable_elementary_models', false) }}"
```

You will run the Elementary models explicitly in one of two cases:
1. When you upgrade elementary run
2. If you choose to disable Elementary models from your runs and want to update them at your own time.

To run Elementary models:

```shell
dbt run --select elementary --vars '{"enable_elementary_models": true}'
```
