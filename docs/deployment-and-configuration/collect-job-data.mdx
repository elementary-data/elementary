🚧 _Under development_ 🚧 

Elementary can collect metadata about your jobs from the orchestrator you are using, and enrich the Elementary report with this information.

The goal is to provide context that is useful to triage and resolve data issues, such as:
- Is my freshness / volume issue related to a job that didn't complete? Which job?
- Which tables were built as part of the job that loaded data with issues? 
- Which job should I rerun to resolve?


**Elementary collects the following job details:**
- Orchestrator name: `orchestrator`
- Job name: `job_name`
- Job ID: `job_id`
- Job results URL: `job_url`
- Job run ID: `job_run_id`

## How Elementary collects jobs metadata? 

#### Environment variables
Elementary collects jobs metadata in run time from `env_vars`.
Orchestration tools usually have default environment variables, so this might happen automatically. The list of supported orchestrators and default env vars is in the following section.  

To configure `env_var` for your orchestrator, refer to your orchestrator's docs.  

#### dbt vars
Elementary also supports passing job metadata as dbt vars. If `env_var` and `var` exist, the `var` will be prioritized.

To pass job data to elementary using `var`, use the `--vars` flag in your invocations:
```shell
dbt run --vars '{"orchestrator": "Airflow", "job_name": "dbt_marketing_night_load"}'
```

#### Variables supported format

| var / env_var               | Format                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| orchestrator                | One of: `airflow`, `dbt_cloud`, `github_actions`, `prefect`, `dagster` <br/> Any other string would be collected but not presented in the report. |
| job_name, job_id, job_run_d | String                                                                                                                                            |
| job_url                     | Valid HTTP URL                                                                                                                                    |



## Which orchestrators are supported? 

Technically you can pass job info to Elementary from any orchestration tool as long as you configure `env_vars` / `vars`.
These are the default env var that are collected:

| Orchestrator | Env vars                                               |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Any          | `ORCHESTRATOR`, `JOB_NAME`, `JOB_ID`, `JOB_URL`, `JOB_RUN_ID` |

The following orchestrators and their default environment variables are supported out of the box:

| Orchestrator   | Env vars                                                                                                                   |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dbt cloud      | orchestrator<br/>job_id: `DBT_CLOUD_JOB_ID`<br/>job_run_id: `DBT_CLOUD_RUN_ID`                                               |
| Github actions | orchestrator<br/>job_run_id: `GITHUB_RUN_ID`<br/>job_url: generated from `GITHUB_SERVER_URL`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, `GITHUB_RUN_ID` |
| Airflow        | orchestrator                                                                                                               |


## What if I use dbt cloud + orchestrator? 

By default, Elementary will collect the dbt cloud jobs info. 
If you wish to override that, change your dbt cloud invocations to pass the orchestrator job info using `--vars`: 
```shell
dbt run --vars '{"orchestrator": "Airflow", "job_name": "dbt_marketing_night_load"}'
```

## Where can I see my job info?

- In your Elementary schema, the raw fields are stored in the table `dbt_invocations`. You could also use the view `job_run_results` which groups invocation by job. 
- In the Elementary report, if the info was collected successfully, you can filter the lineage by job and see the details in the node info. 


## Can't find your orchestrator? Missing info?

We would love to support more orchestrators and collect more useful info! 
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary/issues/new/choose) and tell us what we should add.
