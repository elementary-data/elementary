Data tests are useful for validating and enforcing explicit expectations on your data.

Elementary enables to vlaidate data and track results by leveraging dbt tests and dbt packages (e.g. dbt-utils, dbt-expectations, elementary).
This rich ecosystem of tests covers various use cases, and is widely adopted as a standard for data validations.
Any custom dbt generic or singular test you develop will also be included.  

Additionaly, users can create custom SQL tests in Elementary.
