The Data Health Dashboard is intended for your data consumers and stakeholders, that want to get a summary of what is happening with the data in your organization.

The dashboard is based on the 6 pillars of data observability:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Accuracy" icon="bullseye-arrow">
    The level to which data represents the real-world scenario and confirms with a verifiable source.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistency" icon="code-compare">
    The degree to which data is the same across all instances of the data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Completeness" icon="ballot-check">
    Is the data sufficient to deliver meaningful inferences and decisions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Freshness" icon="stopwatch">
    Whether or not the data is updated according to the expected SLA
  </Card>
  <Card title="Uniqueness" icon="barcode-read">
    Whether or not each record only exists in the system once and there are no duplications
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validity" icon="puzzle">
    Whether the values are in the same data type / format / range as indicated by a predefined set of rules
  </Card>
</CardGroup>


To give a high-level overview that doesn't require deep technical knowledge or going into specific test results,
the dashboard presents the data health in a simple way, by giving a health score, and using a color code to indicate if this score is healthy.
Filters are available at the top of the page, making it easy to see the data health in different contexts.

The total score is a weighted average of the 6 pillars, where the weight is configurable.
The thresholds for the color coding (green, yellow and red) are also configurable.

## Next steps

- **Send a daily report** of the data health to your stakeholders
- **Compare the data health** of different domains
- **Set up alerts** for when the data health is below a certain threshold
