Managing data systems can be a complex task, especially when there are hundreds (or even thousands) of models being orchestrated separately across multiple DAGs. These models serve different data consumers, including internal stakeholders, clients, and reverse-ETL pipelines. 

Our Data Observability Dashboard provides an easy-to-use control panel for data teams to monitor the quality and performance of their data warehouse.
