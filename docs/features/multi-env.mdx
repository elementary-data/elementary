An environment in Elementary is a combination of dbt project and target. 
For example: If you have a single dbt project with three targets, prod, staging and dev, you could create 3 environments in Elementary and monitor these envs. 

If you have several dbt projects and even different data warehouses, Elementary enables monitoring the data quality of all these environments in a single interface.
