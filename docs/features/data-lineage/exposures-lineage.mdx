title: Lineage to Downstream Dashboards
sidebarTitle: BI Integrations

Some of your data is used downstream in dashboards, applications, data science pipelines, reverse ETLs, etc.
These downstream data consumers are called _exposures_.

Elementary lineage graph presents downstream exposures of two origins:

1. Elementary Cloud Automated BI integrations
2. Exposures configured in your dbt project. Read about [how to configure exposures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/exposures) in code.

<Accordion title="Supported exposures YML fields">

```yaml
exposures:
  - name: returns_dashboard
    label: Returned Orders # Pretty name, will be used if provided
    type: dashboard

    description: >
      Returned orders over time

### Automated BI lineage

Elementary will automatically and continuously extend the column-level-lineage to the dashboard level of your data visualization tool.

### Why is lineage to exposures useful?

- **Incidents impact analysis**: You could explore which exposures are impacted by each data issue.
- **Exposure health**: By selecting an exposure and filtering on upstream nodes, you could see the status of all itâ€™s upstream datasets.
- **Prioritize data issues**: Prioritize the triage and resolution of issues that are impacting your critical downstream assets.
- **Change impact**: Analyze which exposures will be impacted by a planned change.
- **Unused datasets**: Detect datasets that no exposure consumes, that could be removed to save costs.
