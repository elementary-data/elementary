### **What is a Critical Asset?**

A critical asset is **any data asset (such as a model, exposure, or report) that plays a crucial role in your company's data ecosystem**. Issues affecting these assets can have a significant impact on business operations, dashboards, and decision-making.

Marking an asset as **critical** ensures it receives **higher priority in monitoring and alerting**, helping you quickly identify and respond to issues that may impact it.

## **What Should Be Set as a Critical Asset?**

You should mark an asset as **critical** if:

- It directly impacts key **business reports, dashboards, or decision-making tools**.
- It serves as an essential **upstream dependency** for other important data models.
- It is frequently used by **multiple teams or stakeholders**.
- Its failure or inaccuracy could cause **significant business or operational risks**

## **Why Should I Define My Critical Assets?**

Defining your **critical assets** helps you:

- **Quickly identify and respond to issues**– Get notified when upstream problems may impact your critical assets, ensuring faster resolution and minimal disruption.
- **Prioritize issue resolution**– Focus on addressing incidents that have the greatest impact on business operations, dashboards, and decision-making.
- **Improve data reliability**– Ensure key stakeholders have access to accurate and up-to-date data by monitoring critical assets more effectively.
- **Enhance observability**– Gain better visibility into the health of your most important assets through prioritized monitoring and alerting.

## **How to Set a Critical Asset?**

You can mark an asset as **critical** directly in the UI:

- **From the Catalog Page** – Navigate to the asset in the catalog and click the **diamond icon** to **"Set as Critical Asset."**
- **From the Lineage View** – Right-click on the node representing the asset and select **"Set as Critical Asset"** from the list.

Once an asset is marked as critical, **alerts will now highlight any issues that may impact this asset or its upstream dependencies, ensuring prioritization.**

## **Test Coverage Analysis (Coming Soon)**

In upcoming releases, we will introduce **test coverage analysis** based on the monitoring state of your assets across key data quality dimensions. This feature will help you:

- **Identify gaps** in monitoring and testing coverage for your most important assets and their upstream dependencies.
- **Ensure that key data components** are properly monitored and continuously observed to maintain data reliability.

By carefully selecting **which assets to mark as critical**, you can quickly detect and prioritize issues that impact your most important data, reducing disruptions, improving reliability, and keeping key stakeholders informed.
