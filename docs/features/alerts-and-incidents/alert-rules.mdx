<Snippet file="cloud/cloud-feature-tag.mdx" />

Elementary Cloud allows you to create rules to route your alerts.
Each rule is a combination of a filter and a destination.

The destination is a messaging app ([Slack](/cloud/integrations/alerts/slack), [Microsoft Teams](/cloud/integrations/alerts/ms-teams), etc.) 
or incident management ([PagerDuty](/cloud/integrations/alerts/pagerduty), [Opsgenie](/cloud/integrations/alerts/opsgenie), etc.)
[integration](/features/alerts-and-incidents/alerts-and-incidents-overview#supported-alert-integrations), 
and for supporting tools a specific channel.

<Tip>
  The order of rules matters!
  When the alerts are fetched, each alert is evaluated against all the rules,
  until a rule matches. The alert is then routed to the destination of the
  matching rule, and no further rules are evaluated.

### Default alert rule

The channel you choose when connecting your messaging app ([Slack](/cloud/integrations/alerts/slack), [Microsoft Teams](/cloud/integrations/alerts/ms-teams), etc.)
is automatically added as a default alert rule, that sends all the failures to that channel without any filtering.
By default, warnings do not send alerts. 
To modify, deactivate or add more rules, simply navigate to the `Alert Rules` page in the menu.
