Elementary Cloud UI and Elementary OSS Report include a rich data lineage graph.
The graph is enriched with the latest test results, to enable easy impact and root cause analysis of data issues.

In Elementary Cloud lineage includes [Column Level Lineage](/features/column-level-lineage) and [BI integrations](/features/exposures-lineage#automated-bi-lineage).

## Node info and test results

To see additional information in the lineage view, use the `...` menu right to the column:

- **Test results**: Access the table latest test results in the lineage view.
- **Node info**: See details such as description, owner and tags. If collected, it will include the latest job info.

## Job info in lineage

You can configure Elementary to collect jobs names and information to present in the lineage _Node info_ tab. Job names can also be used to filter the lineage graph.
