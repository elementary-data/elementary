Elementary provides tests for detection of data quality issues.
Elementary data tests are configured and executed like native tests in your dbt project.

Elementary tests can be used in addition to dbt tests, packages tests (such as dbt-expectations), and custom tests.
All of these test results will be presented in the Elementary UI and alerts.
