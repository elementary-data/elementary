On the Catalog tab you can now explore your datasets information - descriptions, columns, columns descriptions, latest update time and datasets health.
From the dataset you can navigate directly to it’s lineage and test results.

The catalog content is generated from the descriptions you maintain in your dbt project YML files.

The goal is to make Elementary useful for more members of the data team, and to prevent the need to navigate between Elementary and other interfaces.
