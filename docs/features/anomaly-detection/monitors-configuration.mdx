You can change the default settings and finetune the monitors to your needs using the `Anomaly settings` on each test. 

In general, users will rely on the automated machine learning model anomaly settings.
However, in some cases, an anomaly in the data is not relevant to your business. For this cases, the custom settings are useful.

## Settings simulator

For some supported settings, Elementary offers a simulation of the change impact on latest results. 
You can use the `Simulate Configuration` button after the change and before saving.
