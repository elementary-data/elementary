Using the `Result feedback` button, you can mark results as true or false positives. 
This feedback can significantly improve the accuracy of detection.

Some results trigger an automated workflow, and all are manually reveiewd by the Elementary team.

Just so you know - Our machine learning models thrive on your feedback!
We're always hustling to make them even better, and your feedback play a huge role in helping us achieve that. So keep those comments coming!

### False positive feedback

To get context on your false positive result feedback and trigger a response, we ask you to select a reason:

- **Insignificant change** - 
- **Expected outlier** - 
- **Business anomaly** - 
- **Not an interesting table** - 
- **Other** - Non of the other reasons are a fit. Please add a comment to describe the use case.
