### How it works?

The monitors collect metadata, and the [anomaly detection model](cloud/features/anomaly-detection/monitors-overview#how-anomaly-detection-works?) adjusts based on updates frequency, seasonality and trends. 

As soon as you connect Elementary Cloud Platform to your data warehouse, a backfill process will begin to collect historical metadata. 
Within an average of a few hours, your automated monitors will be operational.

You can fine tune the [configuration](cloud/features/anomaly-detection/monitors-configuration) and [provide feedback](cloud/features/anomaly-detection/monitors-feedback) to adjust the detection to your needs. 

<Info>As views are stateless, automated volume and freshness monitors only apply on tables.</Info>
