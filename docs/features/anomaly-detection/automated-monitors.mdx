### How it works?

The monitors collect metadata, and the [anomaly detection model](cloud/features/anomaly-detection/monitors-overview#how-monitors-work?) adjusts based on updates frequency, seasonality and trends.
Further information on the detection models can be found here. 

As soon as you connect Elementary Cloud Platform to your data warehouse, a backfill process will begin to collect historical metadata. 
Within an average of a few hours, your automated monitors will be operational.

You can fine tune the [configuration](cloud/features/anomaly-detection/monitors-configuration) and [provide feedback](cloud/features/anomaly-detection/monitors-feedback) to adjust the detection to your needs. 

<Info>As views are stateless, automated volume and freshness monitors only apply on tables.</Info>

## Automated Monitors

### Volume Monitor

Monitors how many rows were added or removed to a table on each update,
and fails if there is an unexpected drop or spike in rows.

### Freshness Monitor

Monitors updates to tables and how frequently a table is updated,
and fails if there is an unexpected delay.
