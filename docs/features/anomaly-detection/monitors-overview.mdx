ML-powered anomaly detection monitors automatically identify outliers and unexpected patterns in your data.
These are useful to detect issues such as incomplete data, delays, a drop in a specific dimension or a spike in null values.

Elementary offers two types of monitors: 

- **Automated Monitors** - Out-of-the-box monitors activated automatically, that query metadata only. 
- **Opt-in Monitors** - Monitors that query raw data and require configuration.

## Monitor test results

Each monitor returns a test result, that is one of the following four results:

- **Passed** - The test passed, no anomaly was detected.
- **Warning** - An anomaly was detected, and the test is configured to `warn` severity.
- **Fail** - An anomaly was detected, and the test is configured to `fail` severity.
- **No data** - The monitor does not have enough data or an accurate model to monitor. Reach out to our support team to fix this.
