<Snippet file="cloud/cloud-feature-tag.mdx" />

ML-powered anomaly detection monitors to automatically identify outliers and unexpected patterns in your data.
These are useful to detect issues such as incomplete data, delays, drop in a specific dimension or a spike in null values.

Elementary offers two types of monitors: 

- **Automated Monitors** - Out-of-the-box monitors who are activated automatically, and query metadata only. 
- **Opt-in Monitors** - Monitors who query raw data and require configuration.
