title: Lineage to Downstream Exposures
sidebarTitle: Exposures & BI Integrations
---

Some of your data is used downstream in dashboards, applications, data science pipelines, reverse ETLs, etc.
These downstream data consumers are called _exposures_.

Elementary lineage graph presents downstream exposures of two origins:

1. Elementary Cloud Automated BI integrations
2. Exposures configured in your dbt project. Read about [how to configure exposures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/exposures) in code.

<Accordion title="Supported exposures YML fields">

```yaml

  - name: returns_dashboard

### Automated BI lineage

<Snippet file="cloud/cloud-feature-tag.mdx" />

Elementary Cloud integrated with BI tools to automatically extend the lineage up to the dashboard level.

**Supported BI tools:**

### Why are exposures useful?

- **Incidents impact analysis**: You could explore which exposures are impacted by each data issue.
- **Exposure health**: By selecting an exposure and filtering on upstream nodes, you could see the status of all itâ€™s upstream datasets.
- **Change impact**: Analyze which exposures will be impacted by a planned change.
- **Unused datasets**: Detect datasets that no exposure consumes, that might be removed to save costs.
