## Install and configure

Start by downloading and installing elementary-data CLI.

To install the lineage module, run:

```
pip install 'elementary-data[lineage]'
```

Run one of the following commands based on your platform (no need to run all):

```
pip install 'elementary-data[snowflake]'
pip install 'elementary-data[bigquery]'
pip install 'elementary-data[redshift]'
```

```
# The tool is named edr (Elementary Data Reliability),
# run it to validate the installation:
edr --help
```

We recommend using pip, for other installation options refer to the [download and install guide](./understand-elementary/cli-install#install-and-configure).

## Connection profile

In order to connect, elementary needs a profile in a file named `profiles.yml`, (if you use dbt, you already have it).

- Path: `HOME_DIR/.dbt/profiles.yml`

- Profile name: `elementary`

Here is an example for Snowflake and BigQuery profiles:

<SnippetGroup>

```yml Snowflake
## SNOWFLAKE ##
## By default, edr expects the profile name 'elementary'.      ##
##                                                             ##
## For edr monitor:                                            ##
## The database and schema of edr models.                      ##
## Check where 'elementary_test_results' is to find it.        ##
##                                                             ##
## For edr lineage:                                            ##
## Any database and schema will do.                            ##

elementary:
  outputs:
    default:
      type: snowflake
      account: [account id]

      ## User/password auth, other options (Keypair/SSO) require other configs ##
      user: [username]
      password: [password]

      role: [user role]
      database: [database name]
      warehouse: [warehouse name]
      schema: [schema name]
      threads: 4
      ## OPTIONAL - if you want to create the lineage based on queries from more
      ## than the last 7 days or you have 10k or more queries in the history pulled during
      ## the requested dates range, add this parameter (NOTE: account_usage requires more permissions, see note below).
      query_history_source: account_usage
```

```yml BigQuery
## BIGQUERY ##
## By default, edr expects the profile name 'elementary'.      ##
##                                                             ##
## For edr monitor:                                            ##
## The database and schema of edr models.                      ##
## Check where 'elementary_test_results' is to find it.        ##
##                                                             ##
## For edr lineage:                                            ##
## Any database and schema will do.                            ##

elementary:
  outputs:
    default:
      type: bigquery

      ## Service account auth, other options require other configs ##
      method: service-account
      keyfile: [full path to your keyfile]

      project: [project id]
      dataset: [dataset name]
      threads: 4
      ## Location is mandatory, can be one of US or EU, or a regional location
      location: [dataset location]
      priority: interactive
```

</SnippetGroup>

For further information and other authentication options, refer to the [connection profile guide](./understand-elementary/cli-install#cli-configuration).

**Note**: The credentials provided in the profiles file need to have the relevant permissions in order for Elementary to work.

For details, please refer to:

- [Snowflake required permissions](./integrations/snowflake)
- [BigQuery required permissions](./integrations/bigquery)

## Data lineage

### Generate lineage file

Generate a lineage graph from query logs of the databases db1, db2

```shell
edr lineage generate -dbs db1,db2
```

### Visualize lineage graph

Visualize the lineage graph created in the previous command (cached in a local file)

```shell
edr lineage -o true
```

### Further options

For details about the CLI operation go to the usage guide, here is a usage example:

All the options for the CLI operation are also available by simply running:

```shell
edr lineage --help
```
