## Before you start

Before you can start using the report, make sure to install the dbt package, configure a profile and install the CLI. 
This is **required for the report to work.**

## Generate Tests Report UI

### Execute `edr monitor report` in your shell

After installing and configuring the CLI, execute the command:

```shell
edr monitor report
```

The command will use the provided connection profile to access the data warehouse, read from the Elementary tables, and generate the report as an HTML file.
