## Before you start

Before you can start using the report, make sure to install the dbt package, configure a profile and install the CLI.
This is **required for the report to work.**

<Accordion title="dbt package installation">

<Snippet file="install-dbt-package.mdx" />

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Configure connection profile">

<Snippet file="add-connection-profile.mdx" />

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Install CLI">

<Snippet file="install-cli.mdx" />

</Accordion>

## Generate Tests Report UI

### Execute `edr report` in your terminal

After installing and configuring the CLI, execute the command:

```shell
edr report
```

The command will use the provided connection profile to access the data warehouse, read from the Elementary tables, and generate the report as an HTML file.

## Generating a report for single invocation

Elementary support filtering the report by invocation on generation.
The filtered report will only include data for the seleceted invocation (This applies only on the `Test Results` and `Lineange` screens).

There are 3 ways to filter the report by invocation:

- Last invocation - Filter by the last invocation (`dbt test` / `dbt build`) that ran.
- Invocation time - Filter by the closet invocation (`dbt test` / `dbt build`) to the provided time (the provided time should be in ISO format local time).
- Invocation id - Filter by the provided invoation (`dbt test` / `dbt build`) id.

To filter by last invocation:

```shell
edr report --select last_invocation
```

To filter by invocation time:

```shell
edr report --select "invocation_time:2022-12-25 10:10:35"
```

To filter by invocation id:

```shell
edr report --select invocation_id:XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
