Elementary has a Slack integration to send alerts about failures in dbt tests, Elementary tests, models and
snapshots runs, and source freshness.

The alerts include information for fast triage.
Also, you can add configuration for each test / model in your `.yml` files:

- Custom channels - distribute alerts based on their context
- Owners - tag the owner of the model
- Subscribers - let users subscribe to models and tests they care about
- dbt Tags - add custom context to the alert
- Description - add custom description to the alert
- Alert fields - choose which fields to display in your alert
- Suppression interval - set a cooldown period which alert won't sent

## Before you start

Before you can start using the alerts, make sure to install the dbt package, configure a profile and install the CLI.
This is **required for the alerts to work.**

<Accordion title="dbt package installation">

<InstallDbtPackage />

<Accordion title="Configure connection profile">

<AddConnectionProfile />

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Install CLI">

## Setup Slack Integration

<SetupSlackIntegration />

## Execute the CLI

Make sure to run the following command after your dbt runs and tests:

```
edr monitor
```

### Filtering alerts using selector

Elementary supports filtering alerts using a selector.
Elementry `edr monitor` command will notify only on the selector's matched alerts.

There are 3 selectors supported by elementary:

- tag - Notify on models/sources/tests that are tagged with the provided tag selector (Notice that tests can be matched on their model's/source's tag).
- owner - Notify on models/sources/tests that their owner is provided owner selector (Notice that tests can be matched on their model's/source's owner).
- model - Notify on the model/source and its tests.

To filter alerts by tag:

```shell
edr monitor --select tag:critical
edr monitor --select tag:finnance
```

To filter alerts by owner:

```shell
edr monitor --select config.meta.owner:@jeff
edr monitor --select config.meta.owner:@jessy
```

To filter alerts by model:

```shell
edr monitor --select model:customers
edr monitor --select model:orders

edr monitor --select customers
edr monitor --select orders
```

---

## Alert types configuration

By default, alerts are sent on failed tests, errored models and errored snapshots.
You can choose to enable / disable alert types by adding a var to your `dbt_project.yml`.

Below are the available vars and their default config:

```yml dbt_project.yml
vars:
  # Alerts configuration vars   #
  # All set to false by default #
  disable_model_alerts: false
  disable_test_alerts: false
  disable_warn_alerts: false
  disable_skipped_model_alerts: true
  disable_skipped_test_alerts: true
```

## Alert on source freshness failures

By default, alerts are sent on dbt tests, models and snapshots.
You can also monitor source freshness by running `dbt run-operation upload_source_freshness` right after each execution of `dbt source freshness`.
This operation will upload the results to a table, and the execution of `edr monitor` will send the actual alert.

## Customize alerts: owners, test descriptions, tags, subscribers, layout and suppression

Elementary enriches alerts with dbt model/source/snapshot owners and
tags ([see dbt's docs to learn more](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/meta#designate-a-model-owner)).
Also, you can use three custom Elementary fields:

- Subscribers: to tag additional users except the owner in an alert.
- Channel: to send the alert to additional Slack channel (only available for Slack token).
- Description: to add a description to your test and alert.
- Alert fields: to control which fields to display in your alert.
- Alert suppression interval: to set a cooldown period which alert won't sent.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Owners">
If you want to tag a model owner in a slack alert:
- Use '@' and the email prefix of your slack user (find the user's email from your Slack workspace to make sure it is the email this user has been registered with to Slack)
- For example, if we want to tag a user named Jessica with an email jessica.jones@marvel.com in our Slack workspace, simply add the email prefix (with lower case) jessica.jones as follows to your model schema.yml / properties.yml

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: my_model_name
    meta:
      owner: "@jessica.jones"
```

It is possible to tag multiple owners as well:

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: my_model_name
    meta:
      owner: ["@jessica.jones", "@joe.joseph"]
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test descriptions">
Elementary supports configuring description to tests alerts.

To set it up, simply add the description to your test in the `properties.yml`

```yml properties.yml
tests:
  - test_name:
    meta:
      description: "This is the test description"
```

</Accordion>
  
  
<Accordion title="Tags">
if you want to tag a group or a channel in a slack alert:

- Add it as model tag and use '#' as the prefix of the channel name.
- For example, to tag the marketing team's data ops channel add the following to your `model schema.yml`
  / `properties.yml`.

```yml properties.yml
tests:
  - test_name:
    meta:
      tags: ["#marketing", "#support"]
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Subscribers">
If you want to tag users on a model / test / snapshot failure alert:
- Use '@' and the email prefix of your slack user (find the user's email from your Slack workspace to make sure it is the email this user has been registered with to Slack) For example, if we want to tag a user named Jessica with an email jessica.jones@marvel.com in our Slack workspace, use "@jessica.jones".
- Add 'subscribers' under a meta field to your properties.yml file.

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: my_model_name
    meta:
      alerts_config:
        subscribers: "@jessica.jones"
    columns:
      - name: column_name
        tests:
          - unique:
              meta:
                alerts_config:
                  subscribers: "@luke.cage"
```

It is possible to tag multiple subscribers as well:

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: my_model_name
    meta:
      alerts_config:
        subscribers: ["@jessica.jones", "@luke.cage"]
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom Slack channel">
By default Elementary uses the Slack channel that was configured in the Slack integration.
Elementary supports configuring custom slack channels that are configured on your models / sources / tests and snapshots.
If you configure a custom slack channel for a model, all the test alerts that belong to this model will be sent to this custom slack channel.
If you configure a custom slack channel for both a model and a test, the test channel overrides the model channel.

For example, this enables you to duplicate all your marketing model and test alerts to a specific marketing-data-ops
channel.

To set it up, simply add the relevant channel to your models in the `properties.yml` (can be done also for sources and
snapshots).

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: marketing_leads
    meta:
      alerts_config:
        channel: marketing_data_ops
```

If your models are in folders by department / team, another useful option is to configure the channel in
your `dbt_project.yml` file.

```yml dbt_project.yml
models:
  marketing_bi:
    +meta:
      alerts_config:
        channel: marketing_data_ops
```

You can also configure a custom slack channel for a specific test.

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: marketing_leads
    columns:
      - name: column_name
        tests:
          - unique:
              meta:
                alerts_config:
                  channel: marketing_data_ops
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Alert fields">
<Warning>
**Currently this feature is supported only by test alerts!**
</Warning>

Elementary support the following fields for the test alerts:

- table: Displays the table name of the test
- column: Displays the column name of the test
- description: Displays the description of the test
- owners: Displays the owners of the model the test is running on
- tags: Displays the dbt tags of the test/model
- subscribers: Displays the subscribers of the test/model
- result_message: Displays the message that returns from the test result
- test_parameters: Displays the parameters that were provided to the test
- test_query: Displays the query of the test
- test_results_sample: Displays a sample of the test results

By default, all of the fields are shown in the alerts.
Elementary supports configuring alert fields on your dbt project / models and tests.
If you configure alert fields on your dbt project, all the test alerts of all of your tests will display only the configured alert fields.
If you configure alert fields for a model, all the test alerts that belong to this model will display only the configured alert fields.
If you configure alert fields for both a model and a test, the test configured alert fields overrides the model configured alert fields (same as for the dbt project configured alert fields).

To set it up globaly for your project, add the desired alert fields to your models in the `dbt_project.yml` file.

```yml dbt_project.yml
models:
  marketing_leads:
    +meta:
      alerts_config:
        alert_fields: ["description", "owners", "tags", "subscribers"]
```

To set it up for a model, add the desired alert fields to your model in the properties.yml

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: marketing_leads
    meta:
      alerts_config:
        alert_fields: ["description", "owners", "tags", "subscribers"]
```

You can also configure alert fields for a specific test.

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: marketing_leads
    columns:
      - name: column_name
        tests:
          - unique:
              meta:
                alerts_config:
                  alert_fields: ["description", "owners", "tags", "subscribers"]
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Alert suppression interval">

Elementary support configuring suppression interval for alerts.
By default, the suppression interval for all of the alerts is set to 0.
An alert that has been generated in the suppression interval won't be sent.

`alert_suppression_interval` can accept values of 0-24 - represents the number of hours for which alerts will be skipped (including unrounded numbers).

To set it up globaly for your project, add the alert suppression interval to your models in the `dbt_project.yml` file.

```yml dbt_project.yml
models:
  marketing_leads:
    +meta:
      alerts_config:
        alert_suppression_interval: 24
```

To set it up for a model, add the desired alert suppression interval to your model in the properties.yml

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: marketing_leads
    meta:
      alerts_config:
        alert_suppression_interval: 24
```

You can also configure alert suppression interval for a specific test.

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: marketing_leads
    columns:
      - name: column_name
        tests:
          - unique:
              meta:
                alerts_config:
                  alert_suppression_interval: 24
```

## Continuous alerting

In order to monitor continuously, use your orchestrator to execute it regularly (we recommend running it right after
your dbt job ends to monitor the latest data updates).
