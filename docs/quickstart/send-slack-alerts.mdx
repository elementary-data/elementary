title: "Setup Slack alerts"
---

Elementary has a Slack integration to send alerts about:

- Failures and/or of dbt tests
- Failures and/or Elementary tests
- Model runs failures
- Source freshness issues

You can enrich your alerts by adding properties to tests and models in your `.yml` files.
The supported attributes are: [owner](/guides/alerts-configuration#owner), [subscribers](/guides/alerts-configuration#subscribers), [description](/guides/alerts-configuration#test-description), [tags](/guides/alerts-configuration#tags).

You can configure and customize your alerts by configuring:
[custom channel](/guides/alerts-configuration#custom-channel), [suppression interval](/guides/alerts-configuration#suppression_interval), [alert fields](/guides/alerts-configuration#alert_fields), [alert grouping](/guides/alerts-configuration#group-alerts-by-table), [alert filters](/guides/alerts-configuration#filter-alerts).

## Setup Slack Integration

<Info>

**Before you start**

Before you can start using the alerts, make sure to [install the dbt package](/quickstart), [configure a profile and install the CLI](/quickstart-cli).
This is **required for the alerts to work.**

<br />
</Info>

<Snippet file="setup-slack-integration.mdx" />

## Execute the CLI

Make sure to run the following command after your dbt runs and tests:

```
edr monitor --slack-token <your_slack_token> --slack-channel-name <slack_channel_to_post_at> --group-by [table | alert]
```

Or just `edr monitor` if you used `config.yml`. Please note that when you specify the --slack-channel-name, it's the
default channel name to which all the alerts will be sent that are not attributed to any custom channel. Therefore,
if you execute several `edr monitor` commands at the same time with different `slack-channel-name` arguments, they can
be sent to the wrong one due to the overlap accessing the backend table of elementary. For avoiding this problem,
[the guide](/guides/alerts-configuration#custom-channel) can be followed.

## Alert on source freshness failures

_Not supported in dbt cloud_

To alert on source freshness, you will need to run `edr run-operation upload-source-freshness` right after each execution of `dbt source freshness`.
This operation will upload the results to a table, and the execution of `edr monitor` will send the actual alert.

- Note that it needs to be from the same machine.
- Note that this requires passing `--project-dir` argument.

## Continuous alerting

In order to monitor continuously, use your orchestrator to execute it regularly (we recommend running it right after
your dbt job ends to monitor the latest data updates).
