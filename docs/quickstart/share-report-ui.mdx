title: "Share observability report"
---

Distribute the report by sending it to external platforms using the command `edr monitor send-report`.
You can specify more than one platform in the command, and the report will be sent to all.
All arguments can be passed either as CLI arguments or in the `config.yml` file.

## Slack

After you [setup a Slack app and token](../integrations/slack#slack-integration-setup) you can run the command:

```shell
edr monitor send-report --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME>
```

A report will be sent to your Slack channel.

### Configuration

If you prefer to use `config.yml` file, you can add the following configuration instead of the CLI arguments:

```yml
slack:
  token: [ Slack token ]
  channel_name: [ Slack channel ]
```

## Amazon S3

The prerequisites are to
have [AWS access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html) and
an [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html).

If you already have
a [`~/.aws/credentials`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-where)
file, you can run the command and provide only the profile name and the bucket's name:

```shell
edr monitor send-report --aws-profile-name <AWS_PROFILE> --s3-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

Alternatively, you can pass the access key ID and secret access key:

```shell
edr monitor send-report --aws-access-key-id <ACCESS_KEY_ID> --aws-secret-access-key <SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> --s3-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

### Hosting the report as a website

You can host the report as the bucket's website so that you can browse to it with a constant URL
like `https://<Elementary-Report-Bucket>.s3-website.<Region>.amazonaws.com`.
In order to do that, you'll need to complete **steps 1-4** on
the [configure a website on the bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html)
guide.
After you've completed it, pass `--update-bucket-website true` to `send-report` in order to update the main page of
the bucket's website.

### Configuration

If you prefer to use `config.yml` file, you can add the following configuration instead of the CLI arguments:

```yml
aws:
  profile_name: [ AWS profile name ]
  s3_bucket_name: [ S3 bucket name ]
update_bucket_website: [ true | false ]
```

## Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

The prerequisites are to have
a [Google service account file](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) and
a [GCS bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets).
Once you have it, you can send the report to your GCS bucket by running the command:

```shell
edr monitor send-report --google-service-account-path <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH> --gcs-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

### Hosting the report as a website

You can host the report as the bucket's website so that you can browse to it with a constant URL
like `https://storage.googleapis.com/<Elementary-Report-Bucket>/index.html`.
Here's [an example](https://storage.googleapis.com/elementary_static/elementary_demo.html).
In order to do that, pass `--update-bucket-website true` to `send-report` in order to update the `index.html` file in
the bucket.

_Note_: You might want to [limit or grant access](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control) to your reports
bucket to certain users.

### Configuration

If you prefer to use `config.yml` file, you can add the following configuration instead of the CLI arguments:

```yml
google:
  service_account_path: [ Google service account path ]
  gcs_bucket_name: [ GCS bucket name ]
update_bucket_website: [ true | false ]
```
