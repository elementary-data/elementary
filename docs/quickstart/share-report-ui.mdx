title: "Share observability report"
---

Generate and distribute the report to external platforms by using the command `edr send-report`. 
You can specify more than one platform in the command, and the report will be sent to all.
All arguments can be passed either as CLI arguments or in the `config.yml` file.

### Share via Slack

You can share the report via Slack as an html attachement. The slack notification will also include a summary of the test results (see [possible configurations below](/quickstart/share-report-ui#slack-summary-configurations)).
After you [set up a Slack app and token](/integrations/slack#slack-integration-setup) you can run the command:

```shell
edr send-report --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME>
```

You can control the name of the report by providing `--slack-file-name <REPORT_NAME>` to the `edr send-report`
command. Make sure the report name you provided ends with `.html`.


#### Configuration

If you prefer to use `config.yml` file, you can add the following configuration instead of the CLI arguments:

```yml
slack:
  token: [Slack token]
  channel_name: [Slack channel]
```

If you wish to share only the test results summary (without the attached report) - you can disable the report attachment using the `disable` config:

```shell
edr send-report --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME> --disable html_attachment
```

### Host the report

<Accordion title="Amazon S3">

The prerequisites are to
have [AWS access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html) and
an [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html).

If you already have
a [`~/.aws/credentials`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-where)
file, you can run the command and provide only the profile name and the bucket's name:

```shell
edr send-report --aws-profile-name <AWS_PROFILE> --s3-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

Alternatively, you can pass the access key ID and secret access key:

```shell
edr send-report --aws-access-key-id <ACCESS_KEY_ID> --aws-secret-access-key <SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> --s3-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

You can control the location of the report in the bucket by providing `--bucket-file-path <REPORT_PATH>` to
the `edr send-report` command. Make sure the report's file name ends with `.html`.

#### Sharing results summary via Slack
To enable the Slack results summary when hosting the report, you will need to configure the Slack platform as well.
After you [set up a Slack app and token](/integrations/slack#slack-integration-setup) you can run the following command:

```shell
edr send-report --aws-profile-name <AWS_PROFILE> --s3-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME> --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME>
```

#### Hosting the report as a website

You can host the report as the bucket's website so that you can browse to it with a constant URL
like `https://<Elementary-Report-Bucket>.s3-website.<Region>.amazonaws.com`.
In order to do that, you'll need to complete **steps 1-4** on
the [configure a website on the bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html)
guide.
After you've completed it, pass `--update-bucket-website true` to `send-report` in order to update the main page of
the bucket's website.

#### Configuration

If you prefer to use `config.yml` file, you can add the following configuration instead of the CLI arguments:

```yml
aws:
  profile_name: [AWS profile name]
  s3_bucket_name: [S3 bucket name]

update_bucket_website: [true | false]
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Google Cloud Storage (GCS)">

The prerequisite is to have a [GCS bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets).  
Once you have it, you'll need to provide one of two ways to authenticate:

#### [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) (Recommended)

you can send the report to your GCS bucket by running the command:

```shell
edr send-report --google-service-account-path <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH> --gcs-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

#### OAuth using `gcloud`

If you're using OAuth with `gcloud`, simply omit `--google-service-account-path`:

```shell
edr send-report --gcs-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

You can control the location of the report in the bucket by providing `--bucket-file-path <REPORT_PATH>` to
the `edr send-report` command. Make sure the report's file name ends with `.html`.

#### Sharing results summary via Slack
To enable the Slack results summary when hosting the report, you will need to configure the Slack platform as well.
After you [set up a Slack app and token](/integrations/slack#slack-integration-setup) you can run the following command:

```shell
edr send-report --aws-profile-name <AWS_PROFILE> --s3-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME> --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME>
```

#### Hosting the report as a website

You can host the report as the bucket's website so that you can browse to it with a constant URL
like `https://storage.googleapis.com/<Elementary-Report-Bucket>/index.html`.
Here's [an example](https://storage.googleapis.com/elementary_static/elementary_demo.html).
In order to do that, pass `--update-bucket-website true` to `send-report` in order to update the `index.html` file in
the bucket.

_Note_: You might want to [limit or grant access](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control) to your reports
bucket to certain users.

#### Configuration

If you prefer to use `config.yml` file, you can add the following configuration instead of the CLI arguments:

```yml
google:
  service_account_path: [Google service account path]
  gcs_bucket_name: [GCS bucket name]

update_bucket_website: [true | false]
```

</Accordion>

### Slack summary configurations

The following configurations allow you to adjust the Slack test result summary. 

#### Filter results summary 

You can filter your results summary by a specific tag, owner or model.

To filter by tag:
```shell
edr send-report --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME> --select tag:finance
```

To filter by owner:
```shell
edr send-report --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME> --select config.meta.owner:@jeff
```

To filter by model:
```shell
edr send-report --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME> --select model:customers

edr send-report --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME> --select customers
```

#### Include test descriptions

For a quick high level overview and to avoid reaching Slack's row limit, the default test results summary does not include test descriptions.
The test descriptions can be included in your summary, but it is only recommended if you have a small number of failures. 

The following `include` configuration will allow you to add descriptions:

```shell
edr send-report --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME> --include descriptions
```
