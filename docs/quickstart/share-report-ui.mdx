You can share the report with others by using the command:
```shell
edr send-report
```
The command will generate and upload the report to the supported external platforms:

- [Amazon S3](/guides/share-observability-report/host-on-s3)
- [Google GCS](/guides/share-observability-report/host-on-gcs)
- [Share via Slack](/guides/share-observability-report/share-via-slack) (as an attachment)

In addition to distributing the report itself, you can send a [report summary notification to Slack](/guides/share-observability-report/send-report-summary) (relevant to all supported platforms).
This is useful for you and your team members to understand quickly if there is something in the new report you should address.

<Info>
- It is possible to specify more than one platform in the command, and the report will be sent to all.
- All arguments can be passed either as CLI arguments or in the `config.yml` file.

After you decide how to distribute the report and set up the relevant platform, read about how to [deploy Elementary in production](/deployment-and-configuration/elementary-in-production).
