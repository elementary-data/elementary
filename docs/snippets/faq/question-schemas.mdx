<Accordion title="What schemas Elementary adds? What is '__tests' schema?">

We recommend configuring a dedicated schema for the Elementary models.

Also, Elementary creates a schema to store temp tables with results of elementary anomaly detection tests.
As some users have hundreds of Elementary tests, we didn't want tons of small tables to be created in the Elementary schema.
These results are later merged to the incremental tables in the main elementary schema.

The schemas structure would be:

- Your schemas
- Elementary models schema - The schema name is configured under your `dbt_project.yml`.
- Elementary temp test results schema - The Elementary schema name with `__test` suffix.

You may change the suffix of the tests schema using a var:
```yml dbt_project.yml
vars:
  tests_schema_name: '_test_results'
```
