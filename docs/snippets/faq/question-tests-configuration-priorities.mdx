<Accordion title="How test configurations are prioritized?">

The configuration of Elementary is dbt native and follows the same priorities and inheritance.
The more granular and specific configuration overrides the less granular one.

Elementary searches and prioritizes configuration in the following order:

**For models tests:**

1. Test arguments.
2. Tests path configuration under `tests` key in `dbt_project.yml`.
3. Model configuration.
4. Path configuration under `models` key in `dbt_project.yml`.
5. Global vars in `dbt_project.yml`.

**For sources tests:**

1. Test arguments.
2. Tests path configuration under `tests` key in `dbt_project.yml`.
3. Table configuration.
4. Source configuration.
5. Global vars in `dbt_project.yml`.
