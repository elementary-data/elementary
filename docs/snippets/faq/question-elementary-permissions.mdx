<Accordion title="What permissions Elementary requires?">

The CLI needs to have permissions to access the `profiles.yml` file with the relevant profile, write files to disk,
and network access to the data warehouse.

Also, in the `elementary` profile, the credentials should have permissions to read and write the elementary schema, and execute queries.
