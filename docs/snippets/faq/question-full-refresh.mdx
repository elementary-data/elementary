<Accordion title="How to run full-refresh / truncate Elementary's incremental models?">

Elementary’s incremental models aren’t truncated by the standard full refresh flag. This is because generally you wouldn’t want those models to truncate

To run full-refresh, use the `elementary_full_refresh` var like this:

```shell
dbt run --select elementary --vars '{"elementary_full_refresh": "true"}
```
