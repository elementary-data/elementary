<Accordion title="Can I disable the `on-run-end` hooks or results uploading?">

You can use the disablement vars or disable the entire package in your `dbt_project.yml`.
It's possible to configure to disable with a condition like specific env.

Here are examples:

Disable specific hooks (the recommended method) -

```yaml dbt_project.yml
vars:
  disable_run_results: "{{ target.name not in ['prod','analytics'] }}"
  disable_tests_results: "{{ target.name != 'prod' }}"
  disable_dbt_artifacts_autoupload: "{{ target.name != 'prod' }}"
  disable_dbt_invocation_autoupload: "{{ target.name != 'prod' }}"
```

Disable the whole package (Elementary tests won't work) -

```yaml dbt_project.yml
models:
  elementary:
    +schema: "elementary"
    +enabled: "{{ target.name in ['prod','analytics'] }}"
```
