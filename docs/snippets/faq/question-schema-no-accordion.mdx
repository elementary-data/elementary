The Elementary package creates various models to store information about collected dbt artifacts and test results.

To avoid mixing with your existing models, we recommend configuring a dedicated schema for the Elementary models using
the [dbt custom schema](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-schemas)
option.
Here is an example configuration, that creates a schema with the suffix '\_elementary' for elementary models:

```yml dbt_project.yml
models:
  elementary:
    +schema: elementary
```
