<Accordion title="Can I control the test result samples?">

Yes! Elementary saves samples of failed test rows and stores them in the table `test_result_rows`, then displays them in the *Results* tab of the report.

By default, Elementary saves **5 rows per test**, but you have several options to control this:

- **Change the sample size** globally or per-test using `test_sample_row_count`
- **Disable samples** for specific tests using `disable_test_samples` in the test meta
- **Protect PII** by automatically disabling samples for tables tagged with sensitive data tags
- **Elementary Cloud users** can also request environment-level controls from the Elementary team

For example, to save 10 rows per test, add the following to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yaml
vars:
  test_sample_row_count: 10
```

To disable samples entirely, set it to `0`:

```yaml
vars:
  test_sample_row_count: 0
```

For the full list of controls including per-test overrides, PII protection, and Cloud options, see [Test Result Samples](/data-tests/test-result-samples).
