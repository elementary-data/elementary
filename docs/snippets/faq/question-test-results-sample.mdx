<Accordion title="Can I see more result samples in the report?">

Yes you can!

Elementary saves samples of failed test rows and stores them in the table `test_result_rows`, then displays them in the *Results* tab of the report.

By default, Elementary saves 5 rows per test, but you can change this number by setting the variable `test_sample_row_count` to the number of rows you want to save. For example, to save 10 rows per test, add the following to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yaml
vars:
  test_sample_row_count: 10
```

Or use the `--vars` flag when you run `dbt test`:

```shell
dbt test --vars '{"test_sample_row_count": 10}'
```

***NOTE***: The larger the number of rows you save, the more data you will store in your database. This can affect the performance and cost, depending on your database.
