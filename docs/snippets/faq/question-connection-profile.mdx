<Accordion title="What is a connection profile?">

Elementary requires connection details and credentials to connect to the data warehouse.

These are configured in a connection profile using a file named `profiles.yml`.

**We recommend creating a dedicated database, or at least a schema.**

Elementary leverages dbt's [connection profile](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile) format.

**dbt-core users**
Just add a profile with the relevant details, and name it `elementary`.
