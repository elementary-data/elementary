Out-of-the-box ML-powered monitoring for freshness and volume issues on all production tables.
The automated monitors feature provides broad coverage and detection of critical pipeline issues, without any configuration effort.

These monitors track updates to tables, and will detect data delays, incomplete updates, and significant volume changes.
Additionally, there will be no increase in compute costs as the monitors leverage only warehouse metadata (e.g. information schema, query history).
