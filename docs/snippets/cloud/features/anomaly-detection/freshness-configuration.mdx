You can choose between 2 detection methods for the Freshness monitor- Automatic and Manual.
- **Automatic** - Elementary uses machine learning models to detect anomalies in the data freshness. This is the default setting. You can change the sensitivity level to *Low*, *Medium*, or *High*.
For each level, you will see a simulation of the change impact on the latest result, and you can use the`Simulate Configuration` button to examine the change impact.
- **Manual** - You can set the SLA breach threshold for the freshness monitor manually. This is useful for assets that are updated regularly at the same time every day, hour or week.
