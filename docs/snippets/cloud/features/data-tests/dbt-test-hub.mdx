To help you find the test that is right for your use case, we created the [dbt Test Hub](https://www.elementary-data.com/dbt-test-hub).
It's a searchable catalog of all the tests supported in Elementary, with their descriptions and example use cases.

The tests are also segmented to use cases, so you can easily find the different options for addressing your detection use case.
