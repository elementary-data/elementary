### Privacy & Data Use

Elementary’s AI agents are designed for secure, transparent operation, with full user control at every step. All processing runs through self-hosted models on **Amazon Bedrock**, ensuring that **no data is shared with external services**, and nothing is stored or used for model training.

Everything is **opt-in** and **disabled by default**. You control which AI features are enabled, and every action an agent takes—such as opening a pull request—**requires your explicit approval**.

Each agent may use the following data to provide recommendations:

- **Metadata** – asset names, folders, column names, types, tags, descriptions, owners, and custom fields
- **SQL queries** – to analyze logic, infer lineage, or suggest optimizations
- **Test results and incidents** – including failed assertions and alert metadata
- **Historical execution data** – query runtimes, update frequency, freshness, and resource usage
- **User-defined policies** *(if configured)* – for testing, governance, or asset configuration
- **Commit and pull request history** *(when applicable)* – to connect changes with incidents
- **Chat input** *(if applicable)* – prompts used during the session only, not stored or logged

Elementary does **not collect or share any sensitive data**, and you can review and align our AI use with your organization’s governance policies at any time.
