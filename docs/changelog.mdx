            Elementary now allows the creation of custom roles with access controls tailored to specific data.

            These roles are based on criteria such as environments, model path, dbt tags, or dbt owners. This is in addition to the existing access control (View, Edit, Admin).
            This ensures that users can only access the data they need, helping create focus and security. 

            The creation of custom roles is currently done by our team (in the future you will be able to create custom roles on your own). To create a custom role reach out to us in the mutual Slack support channel, and we will create it for you. When the role is created it will appear in the roles dropdown you see when inviting a new user to Elementary.

            Elementary Cloud now offers out-of-the-box monitoring for freshness and volume issues across all production tables. This ensures comprehensive detection of critical pipeline issues without any configuration effort or access to raw data, relying solely on metadata.These monitors track table updates and will detect data delays, incomplete updates, and significant volume changes. Additionally, compute costs will not increase as the monitors leverage only warehouse metadata (e.g., information schema, query history).

            **Instant operation with no training period**

            Once your environment is set up, we automatically collect metadata from your warehouse, which our ML models run on. The models are operational when the initial backfill is completed; there is no “loading / training period” - Elementary will collect enough historical data after setup to train the models.

            **Native Integrations with Major Data Warehouses**

            Our anomaly detection monitors are decoupled from the pipeline and built on top of native integrations with each data warehouse. We currently support Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, and Redshift.

            Our goal is to make Elementary valuable for your entire team and minimize the need to switch between Elementary and other interfaces.

            The catalog tab enables you to explore your datasets, including details like descriptions, columns, column descriptions, latest update times, and dataset health.

            We've just introduced new features to the catalog to make it even more powerful and user-friendly.

            #### Expanded Support for More Data Assets!

            - **BI Assets and Exposures**:
                - All your BI assets are now accessible in the catalog, allowing you to explore their descriptions, owners, tags, columns, and dependencies.
                - You can view dependencies for your dashboards and other BI assets as a list, in addition to the lineage view.
            - **Custom SQL Tests (Singular Tests)**:
                - Your custom logic validations are now visible in the catalog, making it easier for data consumers to see what's already defined.

            #### Access Column Lineage and Test Results from the Catalog

            Now you can directly access column lineage and column test results from the catalog, helping you answer key questions when exploring a dataset:

            - Which tests are defined on this column?
            - How is this column being used downstream? What impacts it upstream?

            Our new Data Health Dashboard lets you communicate the health state of a data set to users who are less familiar with specific tests and validations and need to know whether a data set is usable.

            **How are health scores calculated?**

            We calculate the health of each data set across six dimensions: Accuracy, consistency, completeness, freshness, uniqueness, and validity.Each test you run in dbt or in Elementary is mapped to one of these pillars, and given a score. The results are aggregated to give a health score for each pillar.Each dimension contributes to the overall table health score, which is a weighted average of these factors. The weight assigned to each dimension is configurable.

            **Enhancing coverage**

            The dashboard instantly highlights any dimensions lacking testing. We are working on adding suggestions for tests that can cover that dimension.

            **Sharing with the team**

            Easily share the dashboard with team members—granting view-only access if needed.

            **Configurable Alerts (coming soon)**

            We are working on adding alert configurations for data consumers when the score drops below a certain level.

            [Read more on our docs.](https://link.usepylon.com/link?ri=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.elementary-data.com%2Ffeatures%2Fcollaboration-and-communication%2Fdata-health&utm_campaign_id=febb4283-0e95-43a9-89eb-0a5cd707b0a8&utm_slack_channel=C06BF7333AR)

        Our new YAML editor allows you to add ANY dbt test that exists in the dbt ecosystem, in bulk and directly from the UI!

        It supports any dbt expectation or utils test out of the box, and you can use it to add your own custom generic tests to tables and columns.

        You can now add a new parameter to your column anomaly tests -  `dimensions`.

        This will calculate the column metrics for every time bucket and table dimension values, allowing you to detect anomalies in specific segments of your data.

        For example, if you want to detect anomalies in a revenue column and you have multiple apps in different countries - now you can detect anomalies in revenue in a specific country.

        Here is an example of how this can be configured-

        ```yaml
        models:
        ....
            columns:
            - name: in_app_purchase_revenue
                tests:
                - elementary.column_anomalies:
                    column_anomalies:
                        - sum
                    dimensions:
                        - app_name
                        - country
        ```

        </div>
    </div>

</div>

### Column level lineage ENRICHED with TEST RESULTS

        We are excited to be the first (and only) tool in the industry that lets investigate test results right on top of your column level lineage graph. With this new release you can filter the lineage graph on a specific column that has an issue, and see if upstream or downstream columns or BI assets  have similar test failures to understand the root cause fast.

        >
        We added test durations to the Test Execution History (the command and control center for your tests). You can now monitor your tests performance and see which tests are taking the longest or if there was any degradation in performance of specific tests.

        Easily sort your tests by execution duration and see which ones are taking the longest and choose the most promising candidates for optimization. This can also be used for cost analysis as slow tests tend to be more expensive.

        We are excited to launch a new `Sync Now` button right in your environments page. You can think of is as a "refresh now" button for your environment.
        If you introduced a change in your environment and you want to see it in Elementary immediately - just click ‘sync now’.

        Here is what it looks like -

        <video
        autoPlay
        muted
        loop
        playsInline
        className="w-full aspect-video"

        An alert is just the start of a triage and response process. We have big plans for making this process much more effective. The first step was alert rules, and now we are introducing status and assignee selection in our alerts.
        
        This should help you manage incidents and collaborate more effectively with your team.
        
        *Note: at this time the status and assignee are not reflected in the Elementary UI, but this is expected to change in the near future ​:smile:*

        Custom query testing is a must-have to validate business logic specific to your data team. You can now create custom SQL tests with Elementary, which will be translated into singular tests in your dbt project.

        The results of your jobs are critical to the data health. These are now included in the Elementary dashboard, for you to get a complete overview of the status of your pipelines. We added a breakdown of the latest result of each model, and the aggregated failures over time.

        To improve UX and performance, we changed the default behavior in the lineage. When a node or group of nodes is chosen, only the first hop in both directions is loaded. To see the rest of the hops you can use the +/- buttons (see video).

        Elementary now allows creating users with different roles. This will allow you to add more users from your team to Elementary, allowing them to view results without giving them the ability to change environment settings.

        *Note: All the existing users now have "Admin" roles but this can be modified using the team management screen.*
