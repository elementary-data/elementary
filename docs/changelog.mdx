## Introducing: Incident Management

<ChipWrapper>
  <Chip type="date">July 2024</Chip>
  <Chip>Incident management</Chip>
</ChipWrapper>

Managing alerts is a common challenge for our users. Daily test failures generate numerous alerts, making tracking each issue's status difficult. Alerts are just the starting point—users need a tool to manage the entire process.

We’ve been working hard to solve these issues and are excited to introduce incidents in Elementary.

**What are Incidents?**  
An incident consists of one or more failure events. Each failure or warning opens a new incident or is added to an existing one. Different failures are grouped based on automated linking rules. Each incident has a start time, status, severity, assignee, and end time. Read more about [Incidents](https://docs.elementary-data.com/features/alerts-and-incidents/incidents).

**New Incident Management Page**
Our new [Incident Management Page](https://docs.elementary-data.com/features/alerts-and-incidents/incident-management) helps your team stay on top of open incidents and collaborate to resolve them. It provides a comprehensive overview of all incidents, allowing users to view statuses, prioritize issues, assign responsibilities, and resolve incidents efficiently.

## New Alert Integrations!

<ChipWrapper>
  <Chip type="date">July 2024</Chip>
  <Chip>Integrations</Chip>
</ChipWrapper>

Introducing three new integrations with communication and incident management tools: - [Microsoft Teams](https://docs.elementary-data.com/cloud/integrations/alerts/ms-teams) - [PagerDuty](https://docs.elementary-data.com/cloud/integrations/alerts/pagerduty) - [Opsgenie](https://docs.elementary-data.com/cloud/integrations/alerts/opsgenie)

## Add any dbt test via UI

<ChipWrapper>
  <Chip type="date">May 2024</Chip>
  <Chip>Test configuration</Chip>
  <Chip>Data tests</Chip>
</ChipWrapper>

Elementary now supports adding any dbt test in bulk and directly from the UI!
We added support for dbt-expectation and dbt-utils packages, and you can use it to add your own custom generic tests to tables and columns.

## Column anomalies by dimensions

<ChipWrapper>
  <Chip type="date">May 2024</Chip>
  <Chip>Anomaly detection monitors</Chip>
</ChipWrapper>

You can now add a new parameter to your column anomaly tests - `dimensions`.

This will calculate the column metrics for every time bucket and table dimension values, allowing you to detect anomalies in specific segments of your data.

For example, if you want to detect anomalies in a revenue column and you have multiple apps in different countries - now you can detect anomalies in revenue in a specific country.

Here is an example of how this can be configured -

```yaml
    columns:
    - name: in_app_purchase_revenue
        tests:
        - elementary.column_anomalies:
            column_anomalies:
                - sum
            dimensions:
                - app_name
                - country
```

## Column level test results in lineage

<ChipWrapper>
  <Chip type="date">May 2024</Chip>
  <Chip>Data lineage</Chip>
</ChipWrapper>

You can now investigate test results right on top of your column level lineage graph.
With this new release you can filter the lineage graph on a specific column that has an issue, and see if upstream or downstream columns
have similar test failures to understand the root cause fast.

## Monitor test durations

<ChipWrapper>
  <Chip type="date">May 2024</Chip>
  <Chip>Performance monitoring</Chip>
  <Chip>Data tests</Chip>
</ChipWrapper>

        We added test durations to the Test Execution History (the command and control center for your tests). You can now monitor your tests performance and see which tests are taking the longest or if there was any degradation in performance of specific tests.

        Easily sort your tests by execution duration and see which ones are taking the longest and choose the most promising candidates for optimization. This can also be used for cost analysis as slow tests tend to be more expensive.

## Sync now

<ChipWrapper>
  <Chip type="date">May 2024</Chip>
  <Chip>Environments</Chip>
</ChipWrapper>

We are excited to launch a new `Sync Now` button right in your environments page. You can think of is as a "refresh now" button for your environment.
If you introduced a change in your environment and you want to see it in Elementary immediately - just click ‘sync now’.

Here is what it looks like -

## Status and assignee for alerts

<ChipWrapper>
  <Chip type="date">April 2024</Chip>
  <Chip>Alerts</Chip>
</ChipWrapper>

An alert is just the start of a triage and response process. We have big plans for making this process much more effective.
The first step was alert rules, and now we are introducing status and assignee selection in our alerts.

This should help you manage incidents and collaborate more effectively with your team.

## Custom SQL tests in UI

<ChipWrapper>
  <Chip type="date">April 2024</Chip>
  <Chip>Test configuration</Chip>
</ChipWrapper>

Custom query testing is a must-have to validate business logic specific to your data team. You can now create custom SQL tests with Elementary, which will be translated into singular tests in your dbt project.

## Model runs in dashboard

<ChipWrapper>
  <Chip type="date">April 2024</Chip>
  <Chip>Dashboard</Chip>
</ChipWrapper>

The results of your jobs are critical to the data health. These are now included in the Elementary dashboard, for you to get a complete overview of the status of your pipelines. We added a breakdown of the latest result of each model, and the aggregated failures over time.

## DAG subset in Lineage

<ChipWrapper>
  <Chip type="date">April 2024</Chip>
  <Chip>Data lineage</Chip>
</ChipWrapper>

To improve UX and performance, we changed the default behavior in the lineage.
When a node or group of nodes is chosen, only the first hop in both directions is loaded. To see the rest of the hops you can use the +/- buttons (see video).

## Role-based access control

<ChipWrapper>
  <Chip type="date">April 2024</Chip>
  <Chip>Security and permissions</Chip>
</ChipWrapper>

Elementary now allows creating users with different roles.
This will allow you to add more users from your team to Elementary, allowing them to view results without giving them the ability to change environment settings.
