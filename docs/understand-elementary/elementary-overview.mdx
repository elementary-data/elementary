Our goal is to provide data teams **immediate visibility**, **detection of data issues**, and **impact analysis**. We focus on **simple effortless setup**, and integrations with the existing stack.

(Not a dbt user? you can still use Elementary, reach out to us on [Slack](https://elementary-data.com/community) and we will help).

## Data observability report UI

Set up monitoring for your warehouse in minutes, collect test results and data quality metrics, detect data issues before your users do.

Data monitoring includes a [dbt package](/guides/modules-overview/dbt-package) and the edr CLI for generating the report.

## Data anomalies detection as dbt tests

Continuous monitoring of data quality metrics, freshness, volume and schema changes, including anomaly detection, configured and executed as dbt tests.

Data anomalies tests are included in the [dbt package](/guides/modules-overview/dbt-package).

## dbt artifacts uploader

Monitor the operations of your dbt easily. Collect dbt artifacts, run and test results as part of your runs.

The dbt artifacts uploader is included in the [dbt package](/guides/modules-overview/dbt-package).

## [Slack alerts](/quickstart/send-slack-alerts)

Get notifications on data issues, schema changes, jobs and tests failures. Alerts are enriched with data from your dbt projects, such as owners, tags, results sample and test query.

## Data lineage made simple, reliable, and automated

Tracing the actual upstream & downstream dependencies in the data warehouse, without any implementation efforts or security risks.

Data lineage is operated with the edr CLI and creates a browser visualization.
