import InstallCLI from "../snippets/install-cli.mdx";

We recommend you install Elementary CLI using one of the following methods:

<InstallCLI />

## Install from source

Install Elementary directly from GitHub source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary/releases/latest
cd elementary
python setup.py install
```

### Validate installation

To validate the installation and get usage instructions for the CLI run:

```shell
edr --help
```

## CLI configuration

Elementary CLI requires a connection profile to connect to DWH. Additional configuration is made on `config.yml`:

- **Required:** `HOME_DIR/.dbt/profiles.yml` - Connection details to the data warehouse, in the format of dbt connection profile named `elementary`.
- **Optional:** `HOME_DIR/.edr/config.yml` - Elementary configuration.

(These default paths and names may be changed using the [CLI options](./cli-advanced)).

<Accordion title="How to create 'profiles.yml'?">
## Add connection profile for elementary CLI

In order to connect, elementary needs a profile in a file named `profiles.yml`

- Path: `HOME_DIR/.dbt/profiles.yml`
- Profile name: `elementary`
- Schema name: The schema of elementary models, default is `<your_dbt_project_schema>_elementary`

```yml Snowflake
## SNOWFLAKE ##
## By default, edr expects the profile name 'elementary'.      ##
## Configure the database and schema of elementary models.     ##
## Check where 'elementary_test_results' is to find it.        ##

elementary:
outputs:
default:
type: snowflake
account: [account id]

      ## User/password auth, other options (Keypair/SSO) require other configs ##

      database: [database name]
      warehouse: [warehouse name]

<Accordion title="dbt-core user? You already have profiles.yml">
If you are a dbt user, you already have a `profiles.yml` file that you can use. The default path of the dbt profiles file is `~/.dbt/` directory.

- For further details, please refer to [dbt's documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/profiles.yml) about the file.
- Note: in BigQuery we require 'location' ([details](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations)), and in dbt it is optional.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is a connection profile?">
Elementary requires connection details and credentials to connect to the data warehouse. These are configured in a connection profile using a file named `profiles.yml`.

**We recommend creating a dedicated database, or at least a schema.**

Elementary leverages dbt's [connection profile](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile) format.

**dbt-core users**
Just add a profile with the relevant details, and name it `elementary`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connection profile permissions">
The provided credentials need to have permission to:

- Read - Query history, information schema and the tables configured for monitoring.,
- Write - To the database and schema configured in `elementary` [connection profile](./connection-profile).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to create 'config.yml'?">
Create a new directory and yml file under: HOME_DIR/.edr/config.yml

Here is the format of the yml itself:

```yml config.yml
# alerts destination #
slack:
notification_webhook: <your_slack_webhook_url>
# optional #
workflows: false

# optional #
# Target path for the output files of edr lineage #
traget-path:
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Anonymous tracking">
We want to keep building and improving, and for that, we need to understand how users work with Elementary (and data is fun!). For that we added an anonymous tracking of events using [Posthog](https://posthog.com/) (open-source product analytics, highly recommended).

We only track start, end, platform, number of queries and the size of the graph. No credentials, queries content, table names or anything private (not now and not ever).

By default this completely anonymous tracking is turned on. You can opt-out at any time by adding the following to your `config.yml` file:

```shell
anonymous_usage_tracking: False
```
