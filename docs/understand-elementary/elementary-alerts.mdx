title: "Slack alerts"
---

Elementary has a Slack integration to send alerts about failures in dbt tests, Elementary tests, models runs and snapshots runs.

The alerts include information for fast triage.
Also, you can add configuration for each test / model in your `.yml` files:

- Custom channels - distribute alerts based on their context
- Owners - tag the owner of the model
- Subscribers - let users subscribe to models and tests they care about
- dbt Tags - add custom context to the alert

In order to send Slack alerts after you deploy the [dbt-package](/general/contributions#contributing-to-the-dbt-package) and configure tests, use the [CLI](/understand-elementary/cli-install) and the [Slack](/integrations/slack) integration.

After installing and configuring the CLI, execute the command:

```
edr monitor
```

The command will use the provided connection profile to access the data warehouse, read from the Elementary tables, and send informative alerts to Slack.
