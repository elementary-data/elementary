### 🔥 What's new?

- **Alerts suppression** 💤🔕
  - Don't want to get multiple alerts if the same test keeps failing?
  - You can now configure an alert_suppression_interval, this is a "snooze" period for alerts on the same issue.
  - [Docs here](/oss/guides/send-slack-alerts#customize-alerts-owners-test-descriptions-tags-subscribers-layout-and-suppression)
- **Alerts filtering using selectors** 🔘

  - You can now configure edr to send only selected alerts, using tags, owners or models selectors.
  - This enables you to send only the alerts you actually care about.
  - [Docs here](/oss/guides/send-slack-alerts#execute-the-cli)

- **Generate report for a single invocation** 1️⃣
  - Use selectors to generate a pre-filtered report with the results you want to see.
  - Try it: `edr monitor report --select last_invocation`
  - [Docs here]()
- **Granular time buckets in anomaly detection tests** ⏳
  - Now you can set time buckets that fit the updates cadence of your tables, to get better anomaly detection.
  - The new config enables to bucket by `hour | day | week` and set the interval size as well.
    - Example: 6 hours buckets for volume test
    ```yml properties.yml
    tests:
      - elementary.volume_anomalies:
          timestamp_column: updated_at
          time_bucket:
            period: hour
            count: 6
    ```
  - This was a very popular request here on Slack, special thanks to [Rodrigo Loredo](https://github.com/rloredo) for your help with the implementation!

### 💫 More changes

- Following the breaking change we experienced in dbt 1.3.2, we added dbt release candidates versions to our CI. This will enable us to prevent such incidents in the future.
- We are evaluating a change in how we upload dbt artifacts to improve performance and unlock more use cases. For now you will see a warning message that will not impact your usage.
