_January 19, 2023: [v0.6.10 Python](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary/releases/tag/v0.6.10), [v0.6.13 dbt package](https://github.com/elementary-data/dbt-data-reliability/releases/tag/0.6.13)_

### 🔥 What's new?

- **Dashboard screen** 📊👀
    - **We added a new dashboard screen to the UI!**
    - See a breakdown of your test results, tables health, monitored tables.
    - Understand the high level status and the trends over time.
    - You can also filter by tag / owner and get a dashboard view only of the tables that are relevant to you!
    - [You can play with it in the demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/elementary_static/elementary_demo.html#/dashboard).
        - Already working on making the graphs clickable to enable drill down (in the next version) 💪

- **Major `on-run-end` performance improvement** ⚡️
    - We invested in reducing even more the impact of artifacts uploading on your runs.
    - The improvement is achieved with caching we implemented, to only upload artifacts if there is a change from the last run.
    - *Note that this only works for dbt 1.4.0 and above (we made a contribution to dbt-core to support this).*

- **dbt artifacts additions** ➕
    - New table `dbt_seeds` - A contribution by [Franny Delaney](https://github.com/frannydelaney), thank you so much 🤩
    - `thread_id` was added to run results tables, and `dbt_user` env var was added to dbt_invocations - Thank you [Elias Gryp](https://github.com/eliasgeee) and [Ayal Alon](https://github.com/ayalalo) for suggesting these!
