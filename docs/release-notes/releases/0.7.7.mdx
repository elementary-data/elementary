_April 12, 2023: [v0.7.7 Python](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary/releases/tag/v0.7.7), [v0.7.5 dbt package](https://github.com/elementary-data/dbt-data-reliability/releases/tag/0.7.5)_

### 🔥 What's new?

- **Seasonality and Anomaly direction** 📈
  - On this release we are introducing 2 new anomaly detection tests configurations. The goal is to improve the accuracy and unlock more detection use cases. 🎯💪
  - We prepared a [short video to explain](https://www.loom.com/share/b92d880b768d44a7bd2b0010a6223b62) 📽👇🏻
  - `seasonality: day_of_week` 🗓
    - If enabled, daily values will be compared only to the same week day previous values.
    - This configuration would improve accuracy and detection of datasets that have different volume and metrics on weekends and different weekdays.
  - `anomaly_direction: [ both | spike | drop ]` ↗️↘️
    - By default, elementary alerts on both spikes and drops of a metric. Using this configuration, you can limit anomaly tests to alert only on the wanted direction.
    - For example - If you want volume anomalies to fail only on drop in row count, and not on a spike, just add `anomaly_direction: drop` to the test config.

- **on-run-end performance improvements** ⏳
  - We fixed problems in artifacts caching, and implemented an incremental upload. This means that upon a change to models / tests / sources - elementary will now only update the changed resources.
  - This should improve the performance of the hooks, and we have additional ideas and planned tasks around further improvements.
  - Special thanks to [@panapost](https://elementary-community.slack.com/team/U050WNK4SQL) for helping with this effort 🤩
