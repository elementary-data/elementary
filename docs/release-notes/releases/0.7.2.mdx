### 🔥 What's new?

- **Report Summary Slack Message** 🆕🔔

  - When you generate a new report and using `send-report`, you can also trigger a Slack notification summary of the report.
  - This is useful for you and your team members to understand quickly if there is something in the new report you should address.
  - [Docs here](/quickstart/share-report-ui#slack-summary-configurations), screen shot attached 📸

- **Dashboard graphs are now clickable** #️⃣📊

  - You can click on graphs and the dashboard, and you will be redirected to the relevant set of results.
  - This means you can quickly navigate from the dashboard to a deep dive on the details.

- **Config changes reset anomaly detection tests** 🔄
  - When you change the configuration of an Elementary test, the metrics for the tests will be automatically re-calculated according to the new configuration.
  - This improves the accuracy of the tests, so changes you make will affect immediately and not only after days of accumulating new data.
