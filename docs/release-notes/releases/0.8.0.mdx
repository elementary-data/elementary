_June 1, 2023: [v0.8.0 Python](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary/releases/tag/v0.8.0), [v0.8.0 dbt package](https://github.com/elementary-data/dbt-data-reliability/releases/tag/0.8.0)_
_As this is a minor version bump, you need to run `dbt run -s elementary`_

### 🔥 What's new?

- **🆕 Jobs info from Orchestrator 🆕**

  - Elementary now supports collecting metadata about your jobs from your orchestration tool!
  - The goal is to provide context that is useful to triage and resolve data issues:
  - As a first step, you could filter the lineage by job in the Elementary report.
    - More orchestrator related features are coming soon 😎
  - Here is the [guide for enabling jobs info collection.](https://docs.elementary-data.com/deployment-and-configuration/collect-job-data).

- **You can now configure all test params in the project / model / test level 🤯**
  - Why is it useful?
    - It enables you to tailor the tests to the dataset and get higher level of accuracy!
    - You can leverage inheritance, configure at a higher level (like folder of models) and save the need to configure by test.
  - Some examples:
    - You can set `days_back: 90` to tests with `time_bucket: period: week`, and `days_back: 7` to tests with `time_bucket: period: hour` .
    - You can set `timestamp_column: updated_at` in your dbt_project.yml if this is your convention, and override it for models where it's different.
    - You can set `seasonality`, `time_bucket` and `timestamp_column` at the source level, and it will apply for all the tests you add to tables of this source.
  - We also upgraded our documentation of the [tests configuration](https://docs.elementary-data.com/data-tests/elementary-tests-configuration) and [how the tests work](https://docs.elementary-data.com/data-tests/how-anomaly-detection-works), to make it clearer 😇

### 💫 More changes

- Added `materialization` field to models run results, thank you [@Aril Mavinkere](https://elementary-community.slack.com/team/U058SJFFTEU) for contributing! 🤩
- Removed `env` from report summary.
