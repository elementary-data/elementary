Thank you for taking the time to contribute ðŸ§¡

Whether itâ€™s a bug fix, new feature, or additional documentation - we greatly appreciate contributions!

Elementary code is separated into two repositories:

- [Elementary main repo (CLI)](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary)

- [dbt package repo](https://github.com/elementary-data/dbt-data-reliability)

# How to contribute?

### Open an issue

In order to contribute, choose first an existing issue on the [main repo](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary), or open your own new issue.
Opening an issue about a bug or feature request is by itself a valuable contribution.

On the issue, we can discuss a design and make suggestions on implementation.
